I&rsquo;d hoped it would be a while before they knew you had survived, we must leave quickly if we ride by day and night we should&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;We shall not fly, it is not me they seek.&rdquo; The mercenaries could not have recieved news, with the soldiers killed it would have been days at least before their disappearance would be investigated and after that crossing The Spine would take longer, even if stationed in advance getting message by bird would take time that had not passed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Then who?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;There is another, I&rsquo;ve no time to explain but we must make our way back to the Inn, you shall follow me and wait by the horses, prepare them and lead them round the back.&rdquo; Jorya did not protest, he simply nodded and followed Enoch&rsquo;s lead.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Sir you would leave so soon?&rdquo; Dubaku asked as he turned from his work</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;I have urgent matters to attend to my friend,&rdquo; Enoch saw the disappointed look on the sculptors face and spared a moment to say, &ldquo;May thy flame burn everbright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;As shall thy life.&rdquo; Pleased, Dubaku returned to his work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">They stepped out onto the street, various horse pulled carriages and carts moving slowly either side and folk walking at the edges. Though they kept a steady pace Enoch and Jorya were cautious and observant. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch spotted Missy walk out from an alley, wait briefly for a cart to pass, then meet with her men who sat upon upturned crates dicing with some of the other folk. Enoch watched her lean in and talk into one of their ears and the lad gathered up his mates (who were a little peeved to forsake their wagers) each put a gloved hand on the pommel of their blades and followed Missy along the road.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch whispered, &ldquo;Remember Jorya, I forbid you to kill any man or woman as much as I forbid you yourself to die,&rdquo; Jorya looked as if he may protest but Enoch stopped him, &ldquo;There will be </span><span class="c0 c4">no </span><span class="c3 c0">bloodshed.&rdquo; Jorya nodded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Steadily they followed Missy and her mercenaries, two of them falling in front of her, even though it appeared as though not a single word had passed between any of them. Eyes had begun to turn toward the mercenaries, folk looked unsure by the presence of stern armed men. Missy nodded to her men and the two who led continued to enter the Inn whilst six others waited outside along with their boss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Ah rats, I&rsquo;ll be but a moment boy, I&rsquo;ve misplaced my coin purse.&rdquo; Enoch played his part rummaging through a sack and then hurried to catch up to the mercenaries. As they entered the taproom the Innkeeper spoke up, &ldquo;ah good sirs, I did not expect to see ye so early, how may I &mdash;sirs you may not go back there, it is guests only!&rdquo; Ignoring the Innkeeper&rsquo;s plea they continued their march to the rooms, Enoch slowed to keep well behind them and drew from his bag a small glass jar whose lid was intricately etched with ancient runes, each one glowing as he ran his fingers over the glyphs. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Softly and carefully Enoch removed the lid as to not disturb the mercenaries who knocked on Meir&rsquo;s door. For a moment Enoch could have sworn the world went silent, a single firefly flew from the open jar and zipped through the air into Meir&rsquo;s room behind the mercenaries as they gave up waiting and shouldered the door off its hinges.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;COVER YOUR EYES!&rdquo; Enoch shouted knowing Meir would heed his voice sooner than the mercenaries would, He made a dash down the last stretch of the hallway, a bright light burst from Meir&rsquo;s room and froze a shadow of the stunned guards onto the wall opposite the door, Enoch used this moment to grab a panicked Meir and haul him from the room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Go, run out back, my warden will be waiting for you with the horses.&rdquo; Meir nodded frantically in response and ran off ahead of Enoch who followed only to turn and face the mercenaries that stormed from the room having regained their senses, swords drawn they approached, the nicked steel blades matching the feral look of their eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wires sprung from the floorboards at the flick of Enoch&rsquo;s wrist and wrapped themselves around crossguards and handles, pulling the swords from their hold and wedging them deep in the ground between the floorboards. One of the mercenaries leant forward to try at wrench his blade, the other simply charged bare-handed straight at Enoch. The former found himself tumbling the rest of the way to the floor as a snare of wires leapt up toward him whilst a second snare shot out of a keyhole and sent the latter&rsquo;s bull rush careening into another </span><span class="c0">room</span><span class="c3 c0">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch turned once again and ran to the back of the Inn where men were hauling crates into a cellar, confused at the sight of two lords running past them, they both burst through the delivery doors to meet Jorya who had led Noah and his own mount, a jet black stallion that he&rsquo;d haggled desperately for with a particularly difficult owner the previous night. &ldquo;Get on, quickly.&rdquo; Enoch said nodding to Noah, Meir made no delay to do what Enoch bid. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">The mercenaries had managed to free themselves and their swords and pushed past the men causing their crates to topple spilling milk, honey, meat, and ale all about them, they spotted Meir riding off with Enoch and Jorya and one of them turned to the cart beside them and brought his sword down with a yell, instantly severing the rope that tethered the horses. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d they find me out?&rdquo; Meir asked almost breathless. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Prish, she sold you out to Missy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;What&mdash; but I told her nothing, promised her everything!&rdquo; Meir spluttered in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;She must have overheard us yesterday, it is common knowledge that her betrothed was Qumranian.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shocked Meir replied, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">was?</span><span class="c3 c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch frowned, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t seriously be thinking that you can smooth this one out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;What could a sellsword have possibly offered her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Copper in the hand is worth more than copper on the morrow, you don&rsquo;t think Rubella could match your price?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Jorya glanced back and then turned to inform Enoch, &ldquo;Master they&rsquo;re gaining.&rdquo; Sure enough the two mercenaries had mounted, viciously spurring their horses and riding in the slipstream of Noah and Jorya&rsquo;s mount.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Jorya grinned, &ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Jorya expertly maneuvered the stallion so that he fell behind Noah, the left hand mercenary lagged behind whilst the right one gained until he was parallel with Jorya, who gradually moved across to force the mercenary off the road. Once he&rsquo;d caught on he made a wild slash at Jorya coming from above his head but Jorya caught his arm before he could bring the blade down. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Desperate the mercenary flailed out attempting to headbutt the boy but Jorya drew his sword and for a heartbeat Enoch thought he would break his vows there and then until he heard the slam of the pommel as it caught the mercenary in the back of the head knocking him unconscious and sending him and his mount veering off to crash into a cart loaded with bales of hay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;BEHIND YOU!&rdquo; Jorya heard Enoch in time and leant to the right as a steel blade whizzed over his shoulder narrowly missing his neck, the mercenary behind him leant forward over his horse in an attempt to reach him with a lethal stab, before he could so much as think about slashing right to follow up, Enoch cast out his hand and wires latched onto his arm to pull the mercenary forward out of his saddle. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Jorya sheathed his blade, &ldquo;Maybe I should have a mace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Boy, if you get me out of here safely you may have as many maces as you want.&rdquo; Meir told him drily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch&rsquo;s eyes shot side to side as he surveyed his surroundings whilst winding his way through the pedestrians that dived either side of the road, &ldquo;If memory serves correct then once we reach the wood there should be a trail we can follow to get to Bar&rsquo;Krans?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Jorya replied, &ldquo;Once we&rsquo;re deep in the woods they&rsquo;re not like to follow us, no matter the price on this one&rsquo;s head, though I daresay it is unlikely the others will catch up to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;That is not a wager I would quickly make, these are no mercenaries, they are soldiers that Bekarys has stationed here and . . .&rdquo; Meir bit his lip.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch pressed him, &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Well if they&rsquo;ve war horses then they&rsquo;ll be the toughest breed you&rsquo;ve ever seen, unrivalled stamina and speed.&rdquo; Meir made a good point. When Enoch had been taken to The Hanging Woods it had taken them little time and they had halberds at their sides meanwhile Noah was no more than a liberated carthorse and Jorya&rsquo;s mount was bought for double its worth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Ahead of them a panicked driver didn&rsquo;t manage to slow and his cart wobbled all over the place as he crossed in front of them and rode past them by their right &mdash;the cover flew off the top of the cart and Missy lunged out to stab at Noah&mdash; Enoch reacted just in time and wires flew at the blade but Missy noticed and as she fell she yanked the blade toward her pulling Enoch off Noah&rsquo;s back. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Both of them tumbled along the road and the cart Missy had ridden went out of control, barrels tumbled out of the back as it capsized and the horse went wild without the driver at the reigns, dragging the overturned cart behind it in a frenzy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Meir looked back and Enoch shouted to him, &ldquo;Take the reigns! Ride on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c0">Missy who had risen lashed out screaming, &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Enoch stepped back just in time as the swipe narrowly missed his chest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch did not need to tell Meir twice, he took the reigns and rode onward as fast as he could, soon the beat of Noah&rsquo;s hooves was no more than a distant echo though Enoch could not be sure since he was soon assailed with a flurry of strikes. Enoch dodged each strike that came his way each closer than the last, Missy&rsquo;s footwork was impeccable, for every step he withdrew Missy stepped just a little closer to narrow the gap. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">A well placed feint followed by an immediate follow up brought the edge of the blade rushing towards Enoch&rsquo;s hip but Jorya came to his aid, his warden stepped between them and blocked the blade forcing Missy to withdraw. Seconds later she resumed her assault. Missy&rsquo;s blade carved the air singing a fierce song as she came to blows with Jorya, the two tried to step aside in to each other&rsquo;s weak spots so quickly that their blades were a blur and they looked more like street performers in some feral dance as they spun about each other, refusing to concede. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">It can be said that though Missy&rsquo;s blade was tougher and her armour thicker it tired her quicker too. Once Missy&rsquo;s slashes got slower Jorya took the opportunity to parry the strike and brace his blade with the other hand to push her arm aside, he kicked out pushing her backwards and she tumbled onto her back arms spread out. Before Missy could rise Jorya stood over her and pressed his foot into her swordarm, she winced and grit her teeth but eventually her fingers broke apart and Jorya kicked the blade far from her reach.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Almost breathless, she began to speak, &ldquo;you . . . cannot . . . </span><span class="c0 c4">will </span><span class="c0">not . . . defy her majesty.</span><span class="c3 c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So long as her soldiers don&rsquo;t point their blades at our throats we shall gladly live in harmony, </span><span class="c0 c4">harmony</span><span class="c0">, no more, no less.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c4">&nbsp;spoken like a Lord </span><span class="c3 c0">thought Enoch as he approached where Jorya had Missy pinned to the ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;You . . . you do not understand.&rdquo; A maniacal grin broke her tired face and she began to chuckle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Enoch nodded to Jorya and he backed away, as Missy rose her hands were bound behind her back by wires that emerged from between the cobble. They had caused such a commotion that passersby had stopped to watch them, soon the air was filled with whispers of the magic they had witnessed, some argued that invisible hands had pulled the rider and tied the woman&rsquo;s hands whilst others had noticed the wires and marked Enoch as a fraud but they all agreed that Jorya&rsquo;s swordsmanship had been a sight to behold. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine swordsman boy, to best me with an ornamental blade such as yours is no short of a miracle dare I say it.&rdquo; Jorya turned to listen as he and Enoch walked towards his stallion, &ldquo;You must be young for I&rsquo;ve never seen you in the field, those ornamentations I&rsquo;ve heard of however: The Panther in The West, The Tourney Beast.&rdquo; when the common folk overheard they stepped in closer around him and their chatter shifted from the magic to the lordling before them and his pretty blade.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Flattery won&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo; Jorya stated plainly having to raise his voice over the rabble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Missy replied with a smirk, &ldquo;Oh but it has.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Suddenly the crowd parted about them, they had been so enthralled with the nobility that had graced them that they did not notice the remaining six of Missy&rsquo;s men that had slunk through and begun to surround Enoch and Jorya their blades bared like claws as they circled their prey. As the men drew closer Enoch and Jorya moved to each other&rsquo;s backs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take two of them, they&rsquo;re wise enough to ransom me, use that to flee.&rdquo; Jorya whispered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Kill the exorcist first then I&rsquo;ll take the boy!&rdquo; Missy barked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Enoch did not see who spoke but amongst the common folk four of the men earlier that morning at the Inn emerged from the crowd each armed with a battered shortsword or crudely spiked wooden club. Each of the men picked a mercenary and squared up to them forcing them to turn to meet their unlikely foes whose defiance had begun to stir &nbsp;the crowd that had gathered, few were in support of the foreign men but made their opinions loud and clear, cursing Enoch and all his kind for The White Tragedy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">It wasn&rsquo;t long before the uproar descended into fights and the crowd turned into one big brawl that swallowed them up. The thunder of horseshoes hammering the cobble drowned out the crowd as the folk parted and stumbled backward in a mixture of awe and shock, a tall tanned man astride a magnificent chestnut brown mare rode into the fray. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">The man wore a blue and white gambeson with a circular pin showing through white zig-zagged lines on a field of blue, the self-same design that adorned the shields of the armed riders that followed him and rode into the crowd to break apart the fights. Though the man had the slender face of a Lord he looked half a warrior too. The sides of his head were shaved to the grain leaving a short fringe and copper brown ponytail that bobbed as he rode, he came to a halt near Jorya and Enoch, looked upon the crowd and the mercenaries whose armour made them stand out like a sore thumb amongst the common folk dressed in patchwork tunics and torn hose. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Still ahorse his voice boomed, &ldquo;Stay both blade and bludgeon, we shall have peace to let these men pass through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;These are not your land&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re The Queen&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Missy shouted up at the man, &ldquo;Your voice means nothing here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;That they may but bloodshed serves neither of us well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; Missy jerked her chin towards Meir who had come to a halt beside a woman who rode a snow white mare, &ldquo;is wanted by Vania, Mother of Stone and Steel so she will have him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&ldquo;She will go without him for another day,&rdquo; he turned to Meir who looked horrified as he said, &ldquo;Mayhaps I shall make a wedding present of him.&rdquo; The crowd laughed at the remark drowning out Missy&rsquo;s protest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Amidst the raucous laughter the woman on the white mare dismounted and ran through the crowd, it was at that moment that Enoch realised who she was, she had grown since last they&rsquo;d met and her long black-as-night hair was tied into a bun. When she got closer he realised that there were strands of silver &mdash;whilst some would think it unbecoming of a young woman Enoch thought it added a star like beauty that complemented her silver-gray eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Daiya ran towards Enoch and embraced him before he could protest, though she was taller now he still towered above her as he had many Dawns ago, he noticed even her son stood taller as she turned to embrace Jorya. Then she turned to Enoch and spoke in a voice as soft as a summer breeze, &ldquo;It has been too long.&rdquo;</span></p><div><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
