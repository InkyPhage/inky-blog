The man fixed his gaze on Enoch who cautiously approached them, &ldquo;Get &lsquo;im boys.&rdquo; Growled the man as Enoch was barely within a foot of him, the two patrons jumped him and pinned him to the ground by his shoulders their knees digging into his collar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I shoulda smelt it.&rdquo; Spat the man holding his cloak as he stepped around Noah who fought desperately against the rope that tied him to the barn,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Give me one good reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t skewer you were you lie.&rdquo; Enoch knew nothing he could say to the man would satisfy him, so he stayed silent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">A tear. A single tear. &ldquo;I had a wife and daughter I did,&rdquo; spoke the man as he gritted his teeth his voice quivered, &ldquo;She was my darling, only thing that ev&rsquo;r mattered to me.&rdquo; He reached for a pitchfork propped against the side of a nearby shed and looked up before swinging his head in Enoch&rsquo;s direction, &ldquo;He took &lsquo;em from me, the reverend did, promised us he&rsquo;d clear the kingdom of them shadows but all he wrought was despair.&rdquo; The quiet mournful tone subsided as he let out his rage, &ldquo;Since then I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad to resort to fievery and blackmail just to fill my own stomach,&rdquo; The man leant forward as he reached for a pitchfork buried in a stack of hay and brought it above his head, &ldquo;shame I can&rsquo;t afford you the same luxury.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">All of a sudden there was a sharp whistle as a bolt flew through the air and landed square in the man&rsquo;s shoulder causing him to waver and drop his weapon only inches from Enoch&rsquo;s face and as he turned away his eyes met a man dressed in a thick red cotton uniform with leather-fastened steel-plate scattered across his arms and legs and a crossbow held up in his hand with a second bolt docked and ready. The two assailants that had pinned Enoch froze. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back away an&rsquo; I won&rsquo; have to shoot.&rdquo; Demanded the man and quickly the assailants backed off as their accomplice rose with a hand clutched at his shoulder bewildered by this interference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why&rsquo;re you defendin&rsquo; him, you know what his kind done!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The reverend&rsquo;s responsible for the white tragedy, this here fella&rsquo;s no more than a wanderin&rsquo; exorcist, the reverend&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; For a moment there was a silence as the men looked amongst each other as if trying to decipher his words, but they were stopped before they could formulate a retort, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll scarper an&rsquo; if I catch you again I won&rsquo; miss yer heart.&rdquo; Sneered the armoured man dryly his eyes narrowing as if to push the men away, they turned and muttered amongst themselves as they left dropping the cloak at Enoch&rsquo;s feet. The armoured man sighed as he slipped his crossbow into his belt turning to Enoch as he did, &ldquo;You gonna lie there all night or do I have to drag you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Puzzled Enoch rose subconsciously grabbing his cloak and brushing it off whilst he observed the man stood before him. In the dim light he could make out little more than the wrinkles in his cheeks and above his brow thin and scrawled all over like scratches on a shield complimented by an unkempt beard that he likened to the needles of a thistle. Emblazoned on the man&rsquo;s torso was the unmistakable symbol of the kingdom a chequered diamond and in its centre a bejewelled goblet whose gems were woven with various shades of green, red and blue silks. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone who wants to see you if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; The armoured man beckoned him to follow and so Enoch did though weary of who could possibly want to see him at such an hour. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who is it that I&rsquo;m to meet?&rdquo; Queried Enoch as he jogged to catch up to the man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t give you a name till you&rsquo;ve heard it from him yerself, this however I can tell you, he speaks on behalf of The Queen an&rsquo; that&#39;s all you need to know fer now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They arrived at a guard house surrounded by a tall wooden fence that contained the courtyard where the guardsmen would train, separated from the rest of the village lest they be hit by a stray missile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compound was eerily quiet and the large wooden doors swung open without so much as a creak, inside there were an array of tables and guards were huddled in groups their shoulders pressed inward over their chests and a single wooden spoon hung loosely in each of their hands as they shovelled gruel into their mouths from the generous portions before them. Suddenly a single guard fled from beneath the sheet that divided the medical bay from the rest of the mess hall and rushed past Enoch holding a mortar and pestle that were worn at the centre of the bowl and at the head of the pestle. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Enoch blinked and his eyes shone momentarily as runes etched into his retina pulsated, &ldquo;Magnesium, Sulphur . . . &nbsp;an infection.&rdquo; Enoch whispered as he observed the stains that had dried into the guard&rsquo;s uniform.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Been a swarm of them lycans recently.&rdquo; Said the armoured man, not even so much as looking over his shoulder as he continued towards the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know, fought one a couple of hours a go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Must be nice with yer flames an&rsquo; all.&rdquo; He replied bitterly casting Enoch a glare as he turned the corner up the stairs to which Enoch bowed his head in embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">As they alighted the steps a group of guards from below bounded past them and along the corridor of the first landing to their barracks. once they reached the first landing the armoured man stopped and gestured to Enoch to go ahead down the left of the corridor that ended with a decorated door carved with the same symbol on all the guard&rsquo;s uniforms. Slipping past him the armoured man leant forward to push the door open revealing an office littered with parchments scrawled with diagrams of maps and artefacts whose stained sepia pages piqued Enoch&rsquo;s interest even if only for the seconds they remained still for he was greeted by the abrupt rise of a figure in the centre of all these pages who excitedly extended a bony arm that looked as though it may blend in with the parchment that it had strewn across the floor. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you s-sir.&rdquo; Before Enoch could shake this eccentric stranger&rsquo;s hand he gasped and looked around himself then pranced to the far end of the office tip toeing to avoid the mess that flooded the floor and attempted to grab a wooden chair by the frame of its seat only he had to awkwardly shift the papers that he held so tightly between his fingers so that he wouldn&rsquo;t drop them. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">From the corner of Enoch&rsquo;s eye a man stepped out dressed in rich linen robes of the royal colours and hemmed with threads of purple around the shoulders and down his arms. The man offered to take Enoch&rsquo;s forsaken hand and as he did so Enoch noticed the jewelled rings and bracelets that flooded each one equally so was this man&rsquo;s grin wide and polished as though the enamel had been painted to the surface of his teeth, &ldquo;Please take a seat,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">spoke the man in a smooth and steady tone then all of a sudden Enoch felt his knees give way as the frantic man brought the chair behind him, &ldquo;S-so sorry s-sir I didn&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eilam that&#39;s enough.&rdquo; with a hand on Eilam&#39;s shoulder he was calmed and resumed to sifting through what seemed to be endless reams of parchment scattered on the floor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The man took a seat behind the desk and turned his body sideways so that his shoulders were parallel to Enoch&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Meir and our rather eccentric friend hear is Eilam,&rdquo; Eilam&rsquo;s cheeks were briefly flushed with red as he heard Meir speak of him. &ldquo;And our friend just outside would be Captain Bekarys.&rdquo; There was a moment of silence with only the faint and hurried rustle of papers being organised and then the squeal of delight as Eilam had found what he was looking for, Eilam rushed back over to the desk and spread out a long piece of parchment and placed beside it another smaller wrinkled drawing of a book. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Enoch smoothed out the larger parchment with his hand to reveal a map of the surrounding area just to the southern east of the kingdom and along the coastline there was a red X, &ldquo;The black shore cove, our court archaeologist here has recently uncovered documents that lead us to believe that a very important grimoire is buried somewhere in this area.&rdquo; Eilam stood, for the first time, tall and straight with pride at the mention of his achievements a great smile hung from his once again blazing cheeks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;What&#39;s my part in all this?&rdquo; Queried Enoch still puzzled and overwhelmed by the series of events that had brought him here, &ldquo;There are . . . Anakim in the area and for that we need an exorcist which unfortunately are rare these days.&rdquo; Meir shuffled awkwardly in his chair uncertainty in his voice as he spoke, &ldquo;For that we would require your aid &mdash;in return we would compensate you handsomely.&rdquo; From a drawer at his desk Meir produced a large leather pouch that was tied so loosely that when he placed it in the table it sagged and the volume of copper in side was revealed to Enoch, &ldquo;A hundred coppers advance for your components and double once the grimoire is delivered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Enoch shook his head furiously before replying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do naught for coppers, however I will need components and a map if I&rsquo;m to prepare.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Shocked at Enoch&rsquo;s response Meir and Eilam looked to each other and then broke their gaze to turn back to Enoch, &ldquo;You would help us, out of charity?&rdquo; questioned Meir his brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Enoch stated simply and plainly, &ldquo;The book and what it means to the crown is none of my concern rather if what you say is true and Anakim plague the coast then it is my duty to exorcise them, beyond that you may do what you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Meir slowly returned the pouch to a drawer expecting a change of mind and then turned to Eilam, &ldquo;I will get a list from this man and you shall send one of Berkarys&rsquo; lot to fetch the components he requires whilst you scribe him a copy of the map.&rdquo; From underneath a pile of sheets Meir drew a piece of parchment that he pushed across the table to Enoch and handed him a quill freshly dipped; suddenly Enoch remembered, the parchment he&rsquo;d found, he focused on the quill with his eye looking for any hints that might match it to the shred of parchment but to no avail, the inks were completely different mixtures. As a solitary drop of ink hit the blank page Enoch discarded his doubts and began to write. The words of the shred haunting the back of his mind like an itch he could not scratch.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the dead of night Enoch returned from the guardhouse to the Inn where all save for Peter who was engrossed in his own game turned and stared at him their gaze fixed to the symbols of his cloak, Enoch ignored them and marched towards the keeper whose palms rested on the edge of the bar as he twirled a quill between the fingers of his right hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry master exorcist but I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re full </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">. . . however I could spare you a stall in the stables at no extra cost.&rdquo; the patrons made a weak attempt to stifle their laughter. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Enoch paid them no mind and replied with a sigh of exhaustion in his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the stables.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though humiliating the stables were not uncomfortable for Enoch. He tucked away his cloak into Noah&rsquo;s saddlebags and then hauled them to the stables to suffice as a pillow for his dreary head. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c7">Enoch fell into a deep slumber in which his mind wandered, </span><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;To all who read this, her majesty decrees: find the fruits and return them unto me.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">echoed in an amused imitation of his voice. Why had the Lycan been holding onto an order from the Queen? And what were the fruits that this message referred to? These questions buzzed persistently in Enoch&rsquo;s head as he dreamt and each moment that he thought he got closer to an answer it vanished as if he were pulling the threads from a seemingly infinite cloth of possibilities. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">A sharp jab into his shoulder broke him free of his sleep and a guard stood over him, &ldquo;I got yer crap.&rdquo; muttered the guard barely meeting Enoch&rsquo;s startled look as he turned to leave. His eyelids still heavy Enoch struggled as he looked around scanning for the package the guard had left him, a small crate that though the guard&rsquo;s attitude may have suggested otherwise was carefully lain at his feet and in it had been placed the exact items he&rsquo;d asked for: a vial of tree sap, ten pomegranate seeds, a coil of steel wire, a tinderbox, two dove&rsquo;s feathers and a small cauldron all carefully and organised with wooden dividers. Enoch couldn&rsquo;t help but admire the guard&rsquo;s sense of duty and rose to thank him but found only the muddied hay that his boots had left behind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Deprived of his early tranquillity Enoch resolved to begin his preparation in advance, so he carefully crept outside to the damp fields where he could safely start a fire. He placed the cauldron above a heap of twigs that he&rsquo;d managed to gather and used the flint to light a fire beneath it he then popped the cork from the vial and filled the base of the cauldron with tree sap, waiting as steam began to rise. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Once he was satisfied he unfurled the fresh piece of parchment which upon it had the black shore cove mapped out the lines meticulously drawn to resemble the original, no doubt a labour of love for Eilam, with his free hand he drew a knife from his bags and cut the palm of his self same hand by squeezing the edge of the blade just above the joint of his thumb so that it made a perfect diagonal then immediately he submerged his hand in the boiling sap and watched as clouds of red began to diffuse into the forming syrup. Enoch winced as his nerves felt the shock of the heat and slowly once he had finished he withdrew his hand and wiped it across the delicate parchment and watched as the splodges of the mixture spread across the map, the stains coalesced with the ink in places around the beach of the cove specks of rouge formed like freckles and expanded slowly outward stopping once they were each around the size of a copper coin, &ldquo; . . . Five no six.&rdquo; Enoch paused, there were six spots along the beach of the cove that showed him that six Anakim were present but Anakim rarely ever moved in organised groups as they were mindless beasts fuelled by rage alone they would have sooner devoured each other and yet there they were. Enoch attempted to focus on the image and briefly the symbols etched onto his retina burned intensely as he tried to create some sort of shape but instead the page dried up and the parchment started disintegrating into a cold pile of ash. With his left hand Enoch grabbed his right eye gritting his teeth in pain until it subsided leaving behind a numbness that only weighed his eyelids down further. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gathered up his things and hobbled back to the stables where he collapsed face-first into a pile of hay completely missing the bag that he&rsquo;d thrown first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Unbeknownst to Enoch, who had fallen back into his deep sleep, a single corner of the map had not yet finished decaying and upon it the dots merged into a terrifying illustration of a large and armoured insectoid that tunnelled its way blindly through the beach of the cove, its form animated and its shriek personified by the sharp hiss of the parchment as it burned.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
