As Enoch turned to face them they averted his gaze and looked desperately into the barren wasteland of a woodland that surrounded them, searching for little more than a reason to shun the exorcist. It was hard to hide about the trees for each was a pale grey as though sculpted from clay and the bark crumbled at one&rsquo;s fingertips like fine powder, were the woodland shrouded in leaves the low rising sun would have illuminated any lurking Anakim. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t till midday when they arrived at the cove. The area of the cove was irregular betraying the tamed shape of the map that Eilam had drawn. The rock face itself however was smoothed and </span><span class="c1">coloured</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;by what could only have been Dawns of attrition for late each eve the fierce sea would send her waves as an onslaught. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Eilam and his guards eagerly rode up behind Enoch who was peering at the beach below puzzled at what he saw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;A-ah,&rdquo; stuttered Eilam, &ldquo;I-it would appear that your help is not required m-master exorcist.&rdquo; he looked at Enoch whose eyes danced around the cove looking for any signs of movement but found none. Eilam dismounted his stallion and signalled the guards to do the same whilst he lifted a large leather satchel clipped to the saddle and carefully swung it over his shoulder as he began to scale the rock face of the cove with his body pressed tightly against the rock he awkwardly scrambled his way down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch remained atop the cove, stood looking over the beach in dismay. </span><span class="c1 c2">&ldquo;They had been here.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c1">teased his thoughts as he pondered. Looking for something amiss he swept the rock face of the cove with his discerning gaze as if to dismantle the very landscape with his eyes. He felt something. A low rumble shook Noah and the other stallions who brayed in response, then at the edge of his vision Enoch saw movement amongst the sand, briefly the armoured hide of some giant insect surfaced as it carved its way just below the surface of the beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Get back, </span><span class="c1 c2">Now</span><span class="c3 c1">!&rdquo; Enoch shouted but it was too late for Eilam had finally descended the rock face and was brushing off his robes at the base of the cove. A geyser of sand erupted and knocked Eilam off his feet and blinded the guards at his heels as the large armoured centipede rose from the ground rearing backwards whilst it tapped its thin bony legs against its large vertebrae. Once the cloud of sand had dispersed its maw came into view, a four way split that made the creature resemble some horrific worm and down its throat rows of small jagged teeth that resembled the spikes of a mace dripped with a thick olive green venom whose pungent scent repulsed the men. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Eilam cowered hugging the rock face pleading to gods he had never praised before and as he slowly and stiffly turned his head towards the Anak to see if his prayers had been answered it lent backwards and arched its body sideways as if slowly threading its way through the eye of a needle bringing the side of its head inches away from Eilam as he shivered with fright it halted its movement and a single eyelid almost seemed to emerge from amidst the plates of its armour and rigidly flung itself open to reveal the kaleidoscopic eye that all Anakim shared. Though hard to make out, the eye began to dart about then fixed suddenly on the prey before it. Swiftly the Anak retraced its movements, brushing against Eilam&rsquo;s robes and taking shreds of them with it, then as it once again rose the creature let out a shrill screech as its maw widened spraying the beach with its venom. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Hesitating a moment no longer Enoch found his resolve and leant into Noah&rsquo;s ear and uttered, &ldquo;Ride!&rdquo; Pulling the reins over his head and cracking them sharply, Noah understood his rider perfectly and galloped down the face of the rock hammering his hooves against the rock to form footholds strafing the Anak all the while. Feeling the thunder of its adversary the Anak swung its head and lunged at Enoch but Noah dove letting the Anak crash its jaws into the wall of the cove only as Noah dove Enoch threw a single pomegranate seed behind him that the Anak consumed. Enoch felt the soft warmth pour over his retina as the runes showed him the detailed structure of the Anak&rsquo;s insides from where the seed had slipped through, about a metre from its jaws was a sac from which the venom was pumped through grooves in the Anak&rsquo;s teeth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Enoch gently leant his knee into Noah&rsquo;s right thigh, and so Noah began to bring his circuit closer to the body of the Anak whose long form arched and contorted to track Enoch once again furious that it had fallen for such a simple trick. From his saddlebags Enoch brought the length of steel wire and threw out a fist bringing back his thumb slightly so that it would shoot out of the gap as if he were casting the wire of a fishing rod, only this wire extended much further than its original length, with a swift jerk of the wire it tightened itself to a gap in the plated armour just below where the venom sack was located. Once Enoch knew the wire was taught he leapt back off Noah and one of the feathers tied to the drawstrings of his cloak burst into a cloud of fluff and Enoch&rsquo;s body lightened allowing his body to swing counterclockwise round the Anak&rsquo;s wrapping the wire tightly around the area of body so that the flow of venom was restricted then he let go of the wire and let himself fall backwards to meet with Noah again as he slipped under another attempt of the Anak to snatch him up. Now that the Anak&rsquo;s main offence was disabled the real fight would begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;Enoch leant backwards as the lower end of the Anak&rsquo;s body came hurtling towards his head attempting to whip him off his steed but with little success. Enoch pressed his knees into Noah&rsquo;s sides firmly the horse picked up speed and broke its circuit seemingly heading straight into the face of the cove but seconds before he would crash he instead used the momentum to run up the side of the rock face as if he were to continue his lap in a spiral. His hands clasped together and his fingers locked Enoch jumped from Noah&rsquo;s back once again and flung his boots out in front of him each boot meeting the side of the Anak&rsquo;s maw and forcing it open. With a flick of his wrist Enoch released his fingers and flung his palms forward and for a moment it seemed that he had only fed the monstrosity grain before his laughable demise but an explosive blast echoed through the Anak&rsquo;s throat and bright white spheres of flame tipped with a pale lilac edge formed within, each possessing enough force to tear up the creature&rsquo;s insides and launch Enoch backwards into the rock face &mdash;which albeit was a small price to pay for the desolation he had caused. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Struggling briefly to his feet he stumbled past the immolated carcass of the Anak and hurried to Eilam who was on the verge of passing out despite all that had transpired, Enoch fed him a pomegranate seed so that he could observe the man&rsquo;s insides. His worst fears were confirmed. The viscous venom that he had striven so desperately to confine had spread through Eilam&rsquo;s body and had already considerably damaged his organs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to die aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Eilam half-chuckled half-cried speaking straight for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; answered Enoch, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d onl&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;None of that matters now,&rdquo; Eilam interrupted and raised a shaking finger pointing just past Enoch&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Find the grimoire . . . return it . . .&rdquo; And slowly the archaeologist&rsquo;s life faded his outstretched hand slumped and brushed against Enoch&rsquo;s cheek, it was as cold as iron but weighed on his heart like stone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If only I&rsquo;d told you, this would never have happened.&rdquo; Then for a rare moment his grief turned to rage, &ldquo;If only they&rsquo;d listen, listen and look past the cloak.&rdquo; Enoch turned and kicked the blackened armour of the Anak&rsquo;s corpse and felt a satisfying crunch beneath his boot. Enoch glanced around. The guards were gone and their horses missing, fled for help he could only hope. Noah trotted over and nuzzled his master with concern, The battle had not been kind to him either as his shoes were cracked and looked as though they could shatter at any moment. Enoch stumbled to the saddle bags and fumbled around till he found a jar of salve that he had made many weeks ago. The jar&rsquo;s glass sides stained and little more than a millilitre of the concoction at its base, Enoch smothered it generously across his shoulders back and legs and felt the cold numbness of the salve as it curdled on the surface of his skin, &ldquo; . . . </span><span class="c1">better</span><span class="c3 c1">.&rdquo; He panted through a mouthful of phlegm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Enoch wandered in the direction that Eilam had pointed with his last breath, an honour that he felt he owed the archaeologist, and he noticed what Eilam too had spotted: a section of the rockface jutted out more than the rest with a much steeper face despite sharing the darker colour and smooth edge of the other segments. Something had to be here, something was supporting this section of the rock face. Enoch tapped firmly with his index finger along the face of the wall until he heard an echo. only he found much more. Tapping the wall revealed orange lines in the face of the rock as though some ghostly needle was carving them into its canvas. Once the needle had finished etching Enoch stepped back to see the intricate and precise sketch of a door engraved with symbols some familiar and some unknown. There were glyphic depictions of monsters and items that Enoch both recognised from experience and the books that he&rsquo;d studied in the temple. Instinctively he reached out his hand to trace them only as he did the door crumbled in place leaving what appeared to be the tight corridor entrance of a catacombs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch entered stones lighting up at his side as he passed them illuminating the corridor ahead of him. Eventually Enoch found a small room filled with shelves of skeletons or what little dust remained of them after many a Dawn trapped in the catacombs, at the centre of the room was a wooden box that had the same symbols littered across the door painted on it but what paint was left had begun to flake and peel from the grooves of the wood. L</span><span class="c1">ain</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;carefully inside was a single leather bound book fastened round its spine and across it&rsquo;s opening was a collection wax seals each a different colour emblazoned with different fruits: an apple, a bundle of grapes, </span><span class="c1">and a </span><span class="c1">lemon. Enoch frowned at these peculiar emblems for they had never been used by nobles in all the kingdom&rsquo;s time, he attempted to prize a seal from the book and release it from a belt of its cage but as his fingertip touched the edge of the seal a sharp pain began to rise up his back as though someone had run a scalpel up his spine. Impulsively he yanked his hand backward and the pain subsided, only then did he notice the bodies that littered the floor face down with looks of horror stretched across the dry grey parchment like faces that appeared as though they would disintegrate at the slightest nudge. Enoch replaced the lid on the box and proceeded to return the way he came the glowing stone fading as he retreated, the words echoed again in his head, &ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c2">bring the fruits unto me.</span><span class="c3 c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Once Enoch had ascended from the catacombs he was greeted by the low lunar light sinking into the dark water&rsquo;s surface, a beauty he would behold only &nbsp;for seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Tha&rsquo;s Im, there &lsquo;e is sir!&rdquo; Pointed one of the guards who had escorted Eilam, &ldquo;Summoned that beast &lsquo;e did, dunnah where it&#39;s gon&rsquo; but it killed Eilam.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1">Enoch scanned the beach hopelessly for he knew that the life-giver&rsquo;s flame never rested till an Anak was consumed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Enoch stammered, &ldquo;I &mdash;It wasn&mdash; I didn&rsquo;t k&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;Shut yer trap exorcist.&rdquo; Snarled Bekarys who threw his men aside to meet Enoch&rsquo;s panicked stare, &ldquo;Silver tongued the bloody lot o&rsquo; ya.&rdquo; Enoch only heard the whistle of the dart as it embedded itself in his gut and felt the drug disperse. As Bekarys marched forward he fell to his knees seeing after-images of all the guardsmen that had been assembled and then watched as they disappeared behind his eyelids.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1">Enoch awoke to feel the jarring bump of the carriage through the rough wooden benches and the burn of the rope against his skin as it tightened with each lurch, his hands were tied tightly behind his back by a thick braided rope so that if he wanted to pull himself free he would be forced to unhinge his arms in the process. Enoch could hear the chuntering of the guards just past the curtain of the carriage, &ldquo;You reckon they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ang &lsquo;im?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll gather the tribunal first, wouldn&rsquo;t a brought &lsquo;im &lsquo;ere if they just wanted us to &lsquo;ang &lsquo;im.&rdquo; Replied the second guard pausing to crack the reins, &ldquo;Still jus&rsquo; a formality though, Queen won&rsquo; spare a single damn exorcist since the reveren&rsquo; tricked &lsquo;er.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch only barely recovering from the sedative tried to find his footing only for the carriage to come to a sudden stop and throw him to his knees again. Though the guards drew back the black curtain scarcely any light was let in as they appeared to be at the dimly lit entrance of a dungeon situated at the back most part of some alley in the kingdom. Before Enoch could reach his feet again one of the guards lost his patience, &ldquo;Fine &lsquo;ll drag you then.&rdquo; He muttered as he grabbed Enoch by the collar and yanked him from the carriage after his companion had untied him, and they descended into the mould ridden odour of Qumran&rsquo;s dungeon.</span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
