Not because he knew it would be futile with his hands restrained but if he broke free an arbalist positioned on any of the outer walls would spot his cloak and riddle him with bolts. Funny, how what was once a symbol of pride served as little more than a fetter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rose slowly and silently as four soldiers approached his cell and in amongst them the gaoler with a metal ring of keys all ever so similarly shaped and flecked with the same grime that coated everything in the dungeon. The gaoler wore a lazy frown and cursed under his breath as he fumbled with the keys. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the gaoler found the key and unlocked the cell the soldiers flooded in single file and spread out to surround him. The soldiers had been trained to deal with his kind and though he was unarmed they showed great rigor and caution as they examined him: they spread his palms wide in front of them brushing anything that so much as looked like a crumb, ran their fingers through his hair to check for wires that he might use to ensnare them. Enoch had none. Satisfied they produced a set of manacles to bind his hands behind him and his feet close together so that any attempts he made to cast spells or run would be stifled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">One soldier returned to the corridor and signalled to his companions two of which led Enoch out and the third took his rear. As they lead him out he stole glances into the cells at either side and some of their inhabitants shot looks back at him though none of pity, each and every one of them was disdainful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick o&rsquo; this crap.&rdquo; Murmured the soldier ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Puzzled the soldier at his left asked, &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s &lsquo;at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Queen makes a bloody show and we&rsquo;ve t&rsquo; deal with it, Tha&rsquo;d be why I reckon.&rdquo; Answered the one to his right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aye, by The Mother, my pocket better be ten or so coppers heavier this week.&rdquo; spat the soldier ahead as he braced his gauntleted hands beneath the draw bar and heaved it over, his grunt of effort muffled by the groan of wood and metal. The soldier dusted his hands off and the two at Enoch&rsquo;s side tightened their grip on his arms as the heavy oak door swung open. For a moment Enoch was graced by the piercing rays of light that shone from above. A wash of colours flooding his eyesight, then as his vision came back to him he was struck. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flock of common folk descended upon them clawing at the dirt beneath them and hurling it at Enoch. Though the soldiers did their best to push back anyone who dared get close to him they made little to no effort to shield him from the barrage of missiles they launched at him: stones, rotting fruit, muck and grit were lathered across his face and shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Queen needn&rsquo;t trial this devil,&rdquo; spat an elder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be more&rsquo;n pleased to hang and flay &lsquo;im m&rsquo;self.&rdquo; He bared his greyed teeth at the exorcist as he sneered in disgust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amongst the crowd Enoch spotted a silent mother who held her chin high in contempt as her energetic sons bounced at either side and singing mocking rhymes. Ridiculed he hung his shoulders and head low as they waded through the swarm of common folk who swore countless colourful curses upon him between their bombardments. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they passed through wider streets richer folk dotted along the sides cast looks that lay somewhere between discomfort and derision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As usual the rabble chasten him before his audience.&rdquo; muttered one as he looked the exorcist up and down picking the dirt beneath his fingernails as though the sight made him wary of his own appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">His friend turned away to tend to business with his stall and let loose an exasperated sigh, &ldquo;I see little purpose bringing them in front of the tribunal, we know what their kind can do &mdash;</span><span class="c4">have done </span><span class="c6">even.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Enoch felt a pang of pain in his chest. They were swamped with a mire of lies and truths and he did not know what he could say or do to right them. Had Rubella been right? &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c8">surely you did not believe its people would welcome you with open arms?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The words bit him still. &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">There is a thin line between courage and foolhardy &mdash;don&rsquo;t cross it.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">He winced as he remembered those words, the day he had liberated Noah his master had met him with those words on return as if he had seen all that had transpired. It was not the conflicting message of courage and his resolve that made him wince but the lips from which that memory spoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">The reverend failed them,</span><span class="c6">&rdquo; sung his thoughts, &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">not you.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He discarded those thoughts, &ldquo;That changes nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The soldier at his rear prodded him with the butt of his halberd, &ldquo;Quit yer natterin&rsquo; and get a move on, The Queen&rsquo;s patience wears thin easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enoch picked up his pace in compliance. The crowd of common folk behind them fell back as they approached coliseum surrounded by soldiers who leant lazily against the stone wall yet swiftly stood to attention when Enoch came into sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A moment of respite before the trial as the tribunal spoke their verses. He glimpsed Rubella between the guards as she signalled to have him brought forth the soldiers ahead and behind him went to either side and stood at the entrance to the coliseum whilst the other two escorted him roughly to the raised stone platform where they threw him down. They stole a look at their Queen as if looking for some sort of approval for their ruthless service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For what it was worth the tales of Vania were true, though she had all the beauty and courtesy of a highborn Lady her eyes displayed a fierce yet judicious glare. Her vizier began to pace in front of the stage as she addressed the tribunal, &ldquo;Good folk, before you kneels Enoch Cyrus, who by fate&rsquo;s cruel hand has cast his shadow upon our land,&rdquo; She paused and turned to face Enoch, &ldquo;You stand accused of the murder of Eilam, Archaeologist of The Queen&rsquo;s own court,&rdquo; Enoch watched as her stern look rippled as a sneer tore the left of her face, &ldquo;And the practise of sorcery.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I did not&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">SILENCE.</span><span class="c6">&rdquo; Bellowed The Queen her steely voice continued, &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">I </span><span class="c0">did not give you leave to speak, you shall remain silent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a wave of The Queen&rsquo;s hand Rubella continued her monologue, &ldquo;I present her grace with evidence of this one&rsquo;s wrongdoings, a testimony from witnesses confirms that it was by the accused&rsquo;s handiwork that the beast was conjured.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;They lie. No spell or ritual exists that can conjure the hollow,&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The voice rung in his head like the singing of a bowl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T&rsquo;was by the morn four days past, your grace, that this self-proclaimed &lsquo;exorcist&rsquo; summoned a fierce monster to slay Eilam.&rdquo; Rubella continued, &ldquo;We believe he made an offering to some dark force,&rdquo; A steward presented the cauldron stained with blood and sap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">&ldquo;They think they know magic. They. Are. Wrong.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is this and the reports of my men by which I conclude that Enoch Cyrus is guilty of both murder and the practise of sorcery.&rdquo; Rubella finished, confident of her analysis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What have you to say for yourself, exorcist?&rdquo; The Queen laced her words with spite as she bid him speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was hired, hired by a man named Meir to help Eilam uncover an artefact.&rdquo; The Queen&rsquo;s interest was piqued, &ldquo;They were aware of Anak in the area and sought me out to help them, the cauldron was used for a ritual to scry their positions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella interjected, &ldquo;Meir did indeed accompany Eilam on a recent endeavour this much is true, this business of scrying however is false.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elaborate.&rdquo; Commanded The Queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If what the exorcist said were true then surely he would have forewarned them of this horror&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo; Rubella paused. &ldquo;Alas he did not, he claimed to be unaware of the creature until he laid eyes upon the cove.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see . . .&rdquo; The Queen replied a breathless moment of silence from the tribunal followed as she looked Enoch up and down as if one of her hounds had brought her the corpse of some sewer rat, &ldquo;Not at all an ill informed conjecture I must say.&rdquo; Enoch spotted a wicked smile flicker upon Rubella&rsquo;s face as her Queen spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Y-your grace, what reason would I have to murder an </span><span class="c4">archaeologist </span><span class="c0">and by such unholy means?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella made out to speak but The Queen spoke for herself, &ldquo;Simple, to spite me of course!&rdquo; a disdainful mockery filled The Queens voice as she retorted, &ldquo;You would blame me that your dear old reverend is strung up, your means I need not explain &mdash;look no further than the white tragedy if you must, a sick and twisted promise.&rdquo; Enoch&rsquo;s doubts were silent. There was no denying the toll the tragedy had taken on the good folk of Qumran, a debt that Enoch could never repay yet as inexplicable as ever: The Blanched flame could harm no living soul only purge the hollow souls of Anakim so why had the wretched creatures flocked to it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would wish to know more of this artefact,&rdquo; Heads turned as the Lord at Vania&rsquo;s side spoke up, Enoch noted his tanned olive skin and concluded he must be a Nartsemnian ambassador, a sheep among wolves as it were.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would like to remind you Lord Eshkol that only members of the tribunal may put forward questions, even as an este&mdash;&rdquo; Rubella was interrupted by her Queen who casually waved her silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I shall pardon his lordship this once for I too would like to hear more of this artefact.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eilam said no more than it was an important grimoire, after he died I found an entrance to some catacombs therein I found the book sealed in an abundance of wax and leather.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella shook her head, &ldquo;Another lie your grace, alas I believe this sorcery has addled his mind, he had no grimoire on him and my men scoured the cove and found no such hidden entrances.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that the shred of hope Eshkol had bought him was dismissed, lost to the gale of Rubella&rsquo;s meticulously constructed narrative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c8">&ldquo;A shred, wind, The note!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your grace, on my travels I happened upon a note, an order.&rdquo; The Queen shot Enoch a puzzled look but let him speak, &ldquo;To all who read this, her majesty decrees: find the fruits and return them unto me.&rdquo; when silence prevailed Enoch spoke out again, &ldquo;The grimoire had three wax seals each with a fruit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The Queen could do naught but shake her head as the horrified looks of the tribunal darted back and forth from Enoch and The Queen, &ldquo;Rubella is right, sorcery has addled your mind, first you murder my subjects then you </span><span class="c4">lie</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me, try to beguile me with your mysticisms.&rdquo; The Queen rose and turned to her vizier who bowed her head, &ldquo;See it done.&rdquo; Commanded The Queen simply and sharply.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The soldiers did not tarry long, they made haste to bow and &lsquo;escort&rsquo; Enoch from the coliseum to a warehouse near the western gate where one of the younger soldiers waddled off to return proudly with a waterskin for each soldier, &ldquo;Foun&rsquo; some red I did.&rdquo; as he handed each of his companions a skin that the cradled like gold.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;d yer come across red?&rdquo; Suspicion rose slowly in the eldest soldier&rsquo;s voice as he took a sidelong glance at his junior.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What cap&rsquo;n Bekarys don&rsquo; know won&rsquo; hurt &lsquo;im none.&rdquo; A mischievous grin spread across the youngman&rsquo;s face as his peers jostled him slinging their skins on a strap that ran from their shoulders across their breastplate to the hip.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder shook his head but conceded all the same, &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s our due after puttin&rsquo; up with the common folk an&rsquo; that damned trial.&rdquo; He took a swig from the skin and wiped his face with a gauntleted hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it true yer not from these parts?&rdquo; Asked one of the soldiers leaning in to meet his face, Enoch did not reply.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get nowt from th&rsquo; madman.&rdquo; His friend pondered a moment in dull thought before continuing, &ldquo;&lsquo;is skin&rsquo;s far too pale to be a viper, maybe he&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the queer lot that live on boats.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aye could be, they&rsquo;ve a morbid obsession with monsters too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well matters not where he came from only where he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;&rdquo; The guards began to chuckle amongst themselves, &ldquo;The Hung Woods as we call &lsquo;em, name says it all really.&rdquo; A young stable boy rushed into the warehouse just as the guards finished chortling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sirs, good sirs, horses are saddled.&rdquo; once the young boy had left his message he scarpered off and the soldiers followed leading Enoch to the stables round the back of the warehouse where five horses had been saddled up ready for their journey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Steel?&rdquo; shouted the eldest guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; replied his juniors in unison as they slid blades into sheathes strapped to their saddles and roped their halberds to the other side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rope?&rdquo; Turning to one of the youngers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who produced a loop of braided rope from his saddlebags before replacing it sighing a disgruntled, &ldquo;aye!&rdquo; as he did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good then we&rsquo;re set, her grace wants us to waste little time so we&rsquo;ll camp along the ways and ride directly to the woods, aye that means no detours to Wodenvile as you&rsquo;ve shown we&rsquo;ve &nbsp;enough red to last us a day or two.&rdquo; The youngest soldier kicked the dirt in disappointment before he turned to mount.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enoch felt a jerk as the soldier&rsquo;s friend rattled the chains that bound his hands and pointed to a horse, &ldquo;Get on and don&rsquo; ev&rsquo;n think &lsquo;o tryna buck me cause . . . well, I ain&rsquo;t a great headsmen.&rdquo; The men had made sure he would not escape with the aid of his magic, without his hands or components he could do little more than weigh them down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enoch mounted the horse as best as he could and the soldier mounted up behind him wary that Enoch may attempt to assault him from behind, though what the soldier possibly thought he could do when he was covered from head to toe in steel plate was beyond him. The soldiers began their canter from the stables winding their way through the streets of Qumran making their way to the western gate. The guards, who were sat dicing or at their posts on watch in the streets, all turned to look &mdash;a grave glare that showed each one knew where the exorcist was headed. The animosity, Enoch likened to the predatory gaze of wolves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The screech of metal and rattle of chains broke the silence as the portcullis of the western gate rose, the arbalists who though they had clear vision for leagues stood ever alert, practised, cautious. With a great clangor the portcullis hammered the ground behind them as the guards of the gate dropped it once the last horse had gone through and the arbalists stood at ease though yet surveying the horizon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon as the soldiers had left the walls of Qumran they sped posthaste into a gallop as they spurred their mounts, &ldquo;Hiyah!&rdquo; they shouted in unison and each horse neighed back almost as if the beasts were an extension of their riders. </span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were no roads to The &nbsp;Hung Woods so they made way over wildlands eyeing the woods on the horizon cradled in The Mother&rsquo;s Spine. Enoch took a moment to marvel at the view, The Mother&rsquo;s Spine was a towering line of mountains that separated Qumran and Nartsem parting only twice: Once for Rock Maw Tarn which bled its fresh running water into Stonecut Ravine, a second time the Mountains parted to make way for the Grand Road whose path was ground into a fine loose dirt by the barrage of hooves it endured from merchants and travellers crossing day by day. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the sun set behind them and darkness descended the soldiers slowed to a trot, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pitch a tent an&rsquo; spen&rsquo; th&rsquo; night &lsquo;ere.&rdquo; The soldiers dismounted and began scurrying like rats producing a large sheet of fabric from their saddlebags and a tall metal pole to support it. Four of them went about pitching whilst the fifth and youngest fiddled with a tinderbox and a pile of firewood, frustrated he looked up at Enoch glancing briefly at his hands as if to consider whether it was worth the risk to free them so he might use his own flame to light it. A grunt escaped the soldier&rsquo;s lips and a heavy motion sent a cascade of sparks into the firewood setting it ablaze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The soldier stood, dropped his tinderbox to remove the wineskin slung across his chest and squeeze a thin line of red down his throat in triumph, &ldquo;Tha&rsquo;s bloody good.&rdquo; Something between a wheezing cough and a chuckle escaped his lungs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They spent the rest of the eve sitting around the fire singing bawdy songs, sipping wine, and tearing through cold meats they had packed till they felt their eyelids fall. Enoch looked up to the clear night sky, the stars he&rsquo;d likely see but once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come along now else I&rsquo;ll be in a foul mood on the morn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When morning came the soldiers were hung over yet tried their best to make haste to the woods, any pleasant company that had graced them the day before was gone and they reached the woods just before noon. The stench of carrion was an assault on the senses, clean picked bones hung from the outer trees of The Hung Woods, had the horses not been outfitted with masks to obscure the bodies and muffle the scent of rotting flesh they would have likely bolted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they made it deeper into the woods the bodies became &lsquo;fresher.&rsquo; Though all were disemboweled by carrion feeders there still remained thin layers of skin and muscle. As they approached a tree with a free sturdy branch surrounded by a sparse population of bodies the eldest soldier began to tie a hangman&rsquo;s noose. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The soldier sat behind him shoved him off the horse face first into the dirt, &ldquo;Don&rsquo; carry deadweight.&rdquo; He muttered as he dismounted to push Enoch &nbsp;in the direction of the soldier who was now looping the rope around the base of the tree. The soldier then threw it up over the branch that jutted out directly above Enoch. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The sinister creak of the woods was disturbed by the thud of Enoch&rsquo;s body against the trunk and the cracking of bone.</span></p><div><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c8"></span></p></div></body></html>
