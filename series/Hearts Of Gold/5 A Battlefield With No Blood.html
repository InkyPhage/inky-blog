Rubella noted their armour and weapons as she regarded them. Nartsemnians favoured lighter and sharper weapons, placing greater trust in their mobility to save their lives rather than layers of metal, &lsquo;vipers of the west&rsquo; as they were known.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The messenger boy from earlier rushed to the opposite end of the table and pulled out a large ornately carved oak chair for The Queen to sit in. Lord Eshkol was dressed in much lighter leather armour that barely made an appearance through the folds of his black tunic, threaded in violet with fine patterns of tree branches across the torso and over a single shoulder was a short white cloak fastened by a silver pin that had the Elderberry tree delicately etched into its surface.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Would you kindly escort her grace&rsquo;s handmaiden from the suite.&rdquo; Commanded Eshkol as he casually waved a hand from the boy towards Rubella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of horror shot across the boy&rsquo;s face as he began to protest but Rubella didn&rsquo;t let him. She spoke for herself, &ldquo;I would mind your tongue Lord Eshkol,&rdquo; She pulled out a chair to the right of Vania and sat, her body angled toward the ambassador, &ldquo;We sit the same office after all.&rdquo; For a moment the Lord froze up but his cheeks were not torched with shame, he knew he needed to keep face in the midst of Qumran&rsquo;s Queen for the sake of the Lord he represented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead Eshkol turned and spoke directly to Vania, &ldquo;Forgive me your grace . . . I am not yet accustomed to tradition in Qumran.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no tradition or law in any of Qumran&rsquo;s lore that stated the vizier should be a woman, only that the crown always followed the eldest daughter or her sisters in the event of her untimely death, but no one bothered to correct the ambassador.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vania&rsquo;s voice cut the silence, &ldquo;Well then shall we begin?&rdquo; Not wanting to delay any longer nobles called their scribes who sat on the right of their respective master, Rubella eyed both scribes&rsquo; parchment making sure every word they wrote was candid and fair, she glanced at the ambassador to see him doing the same. </span><span class="c2">At least he doesn&#39;t act the fool.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now onto the matter of land.&rdquo; The ambassador said stroking his thin red whiskers, &ldquo;My Lord requests that his merchants should be offered land the same as any citizen of Qumran, contributing to the crown treasury through a fair tax also might I add.&rdquo; Nartsem was a land known best for its rich exports of fruit and spices amongst many signature dishes that its Lord reveled in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen drew a gentle smile as she gave her answer, &ldquo;Indeed they may, for all regards financial they shall be treated as citizens of Qumran.&rdquo; Rubella nodded in approval. Qumran on the other hand was a kingdom built on stiff rule and military prowess, though it had its fair share of merchants their stalls were nothing compared to the bazaars that Nartsem hosted in the west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador leant back and knotted his fingers in front of him and briefly considered his next request, &ldquo;What of the settlements: villages, townships, and farmland taken from Nartsem in the war?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubella slammed a fist onto the table almost spilling the scribe&rsquo;s ink for which she was rewarded with a panicked squeal as his hand jumped for the well to steady it, &ldquo;Those lands were won justly by a righteous war that Lord Manasses agreed to himself.&rdquo; A just war indeed, she remembered it vividly for it had won her authority as commander of Qumran&rsquo;s forces after she had stepped in for the recently departed court strategist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen turned her gentle though icy gaze to Rubella, &ldquo;At ease,&rdquo; she returned her gaze to Lord Eshkol who thumbed the pin in his cloak, &ldquo;As King of Qumran your Lord will receive joint ownership of all the lands owned by my kingdom that he may lease them as he wishes.&rdquo; Rubella let her head hang ever so slightly in shame. Her anger had betrayed her Queen and it was only through her grace that she had not jeopardised the negotiations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;As you say your grace.&rdquo; Eshkol nodded to his scribe who resumed writing, Rubella&rsquo;s own scribe turned to her for approval and she gave him a sheepish nod.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then they had spent much of the morn discussing matters of law and finance. Once Nartsem and Qumran were united their land would be shared between the two rulers the King&rsquo;s branch would take charge of the treasury and trade whilst The Queen&rsquo;s branch would take charge of military and justice as they recognised their respective strengths. The Queen was still to be given ultimate rule over the kingdoms in accordance to the lore that the messenger boy dutifully recited, &ldquo;Only under the hand of The Great Mother&rsquo;s blood should the land of stone and steel stand.&rdquo; The boy was later revealed to be a gift from Lord Yissachar to serve as The Queen&rsquo;s personal steward &mdash;a role that apparently even he had not been informed of but accepted gracefully nonetheless. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Blood orange rays of the low hanging sun lit the room and glimmered off the armour and halberds of the guards, servants rushed in carrying plates of finely cut sandwiches, platters of fruit and bowls of yogurt (another sample of Nartsem&rsquo;s luxuries).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eshkol put out a hand and one of his servants paced over to his side carefully lifting the lid from a thin wooden box to reveal a silver knife that he carefully placed in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My son made this, and my pin.&rdquo; Eshkol explained to The Queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your son is incredibly talented.&rdquo; Said The Queen as she studied the intricate work of the blade, watching as it peeled the sour green apple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That he is, though my brother in law wishes he would spend less time with silver and more time on politics.&rdquo; He chuckled as he marveled at the blade, &ldquo;It may seem peculiar that my attendant handles it with such reverence but I deign you to look closer,&rdquo; The ambassador brushed the edge of the blade lightly to remove the remaining pieces of apple peel and reveal the design etched along it: a fox thin of eye and deft of claw, &ldquo;It is believed that the living beast provides its qualities to the metal upon which it is displayed&mdash;&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Living.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Nartsemnians were devout followers of the life-giver who would teach them that life itself was magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your idle talk bores me Eshkol.&rdquo; Interrupted The Queen. She took a vicious bite from the plum in her left hand causing its juices to ooze and form pools in her palm, a servant hurried to her side with a piece of cloth and The Queen grabbed it wiping the juice from her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubella let a thin smile steal her face as the ambassador took his turn to feel ashamed, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, your grace.&rdquo; The joy and passion drained from his face were replaced with a timid and solemn expression. A heartless victory some might say but a victory nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her new found confidence Rubella spoke up, &ldquo;I beg your pardon my Lord and Lady but may we continue the arrangements whilst we eat, after all it is to my understanding our guests have not had the opportunity to see the sunset sparring.&rdquo; A bold but entertaining move on Rubella&rsquo;s part, advancing the negotiations were in the interests of both parties but she knew full well that the Nartsemnians had steered clear of the training grounds for their stay but they would not refuse her invitation lest they insult The Queen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador grimaced, &ldquo;What matters have we left to discuss?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why the wedding of course.&rdquo; Rubella answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eshkol gestured to The Queen, &ldquo;Where does her grace wish to be wed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen scanned the various platters before her and displays of rich and ripe fruits, &ldquo;It is customary for The Queen to be wed amidst the beauty of her gardens, yet I am enthralled with the stories your servants speak of the orchards in Nartsem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Say no more your grace, consider it done.&rdquo; Eshkol said, face once again beaming with a pride that sickened Rubella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My court Meteorologist says that a long winter approaches so I would best delay the festival till the new Dawn, ever more momentous wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo; The Queen spoke so sweetly that Rubella was tricked for a moment by that perfect fa&ccedil;ade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly your grace, even now verses come to mind of such a splendid union!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have but one last request.&rdquo; The scribes who for a second were at ease dipped their quills in unison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything your grace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your temples.&rdquo; A cold began to descend upon the room as if The Queen&rsquo;s own mood emanated off her filling the air. Both scribes looked to their lords: Eshkol struck with panic, Rubella grinning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What of our temples your gr&mdash;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Burn them.&rdquo; The scribes did not move a muscle, shocked at what they heard. The same calm yet tempered voice commanded them both, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">write.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The construction of the garrison had been overseen by Rubella herself. It lay in the shadow of the mountain built between the ruins of the old castle and an artificial mire. In previous wars with Nartsem their use of guerilla warfare had given them the edge so she demanded that her army be drilled against such tactics. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The old castle was from the beginning of Qumran itself when it was barely a kingdom and its largest threat was a southern bandit settlement, the castle was used to demonstrate to recruits the use of siege weapons so that they would be prepared for modern warfare. Like the new castle and keep the garrison was built from a combination of pale white and speckled marble, were it not for the soldiers sparring in the courtyard a visitor could have easily mistaken the garrison for a misplaced villa. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Qumran&rsquo;s sparring was different from most others, rather than pairing off individuals to practice swordplay the entire courtyard was a melee in which each soldier could select their preferred weapons: maces, halberds, hatchets, and even the odd scimitar glowed in the evening sun. Laughter drowned out the thudd of shin guards and the clang of steel as the nobles cheered for their chosen &ldquo;champion&rdquo; though no bets were formally made. Eshkol and his retinue did not share in their cheer, instead they tried desperately to avert their gaze from the melee meanwhile only three participants were left standing: one with a halberdier in both hands, the second a scimitar and a round light wooden shield, the third two light maces. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">A hush fell over the crowd as they watched the soldiers&rsquo; eyes dart from each opponent watching their movements cautiously, moments like these were why Rubella favoured a melee rather than duels, &ldquo;In the field of battle our men will rarely fight one on one so they must be trained to fight amidst the chaos, their sense keen and ever alert.&rdquo; Rubella said aside to Eshkol who managed to force himself to watch the standoff. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The combatants slowly edged around each other until the halberdier was pinned between the swordsman and the maceman then the maceman eagerly planted his right foot forward readying himself for a flurry of blows against the halberdier &mdash;a fatal error&mdash; the halberdier saw this and swung the the pole underneath the maceman to sweep his feet from under him. Everything went awry for him as the swordsman attempted to take advantage of this and lunge at the halberdier only to find the follow through of the blade aimed at his head, luckily he raised his shield just in time to catch the blow. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Splinters flew everywhere as the halberdier&rsquo;s axehead crunched into the shield, yet he did not try to wedge it free, instead he drove through with the swing and pushed the swordsman toward the ground. The halberdier placed his boot firmly on the swordsman&rsquo;s shield and wrenched the axehead free and shoved it backwards, the rear of the polearm slamming squarely into the recovered maceman&rsquo;s chest and throwing him back to the ground his mace clattering far from where he lay. Defeated. The swordsman tried to slash at the halberdier&rsquo;s boot but he knocked the scimitar from his hands in one fell swoop of his halberd. The crowd erupted with applause as the soldier dropped his weapon and stood with his fists raised in triumph. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Rubella joined the applause clapping fiercely only to have her wrist grabbed by an irate Eshkol, &ldquo;Why do you bring us here?&rdquo; He snarled.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is the theatrics of our combat training not to your taste my Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Taste!&rdquo; A horrified look of disdain broke across his face, &ldquo;My men have seen this steel bleed their fathers and fathers before them, this is not about </span><span class="c2">taste.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Rubella pulled herself from Eshkol&rsquo;s grip to resume clapping just as the applause began to die out, &ldquo;And soon your men will see their sons and daughters carry this steel proudly onto the battlefield, do not forget why you are here ambassador.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Eshkol stormed off and his men closed in behind him.</span></p><p class="c0 c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The next day Rubella dressed in her finest tunic, a deeper darker red embroidered with silver thread goblets each studded with a glimmering gemstone. Around her neck she wore her medallions: One depicted a man hunched over with a fist beneath his jaw, a second was personally commissioned for her &mdash;a dark steel ring with a depiction of the sword-breaker she wielded at it&rsquo;s centre&mdash; smithed from the shards of blades she&rsquo;d shattered in battle, the third was masterfully fashioned from bone and captured a glorious warhorn. Each medallion represented different achievement; her post as vizier, her chivalry, and the strategic support that she had given in the battle of Lo&rsquo;Woam. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">She puffed her chest out with pride as she strode into the coliseum, another structure from an elder Qumran, its cobblestone walls crumbling and what remained was held in place by the thick ivy that infested it. All around her nobles who had earned their place as part of &nbsp;The Queen&rsquo;s tribunal filled the rows of benches immediately in front of her. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">At the centre of the tribunal sat The Queen herself dressed head to toe, in what the foolish may consider a drab garb, a grey gown with pale blues and copper browns woven so finely into the fabric that it was as though she were trapped in a vice of wires like the coliseum around her. Atop The Queen&rsquo;s head was a relic both revered and feared by many far and wide &mdash;The Crown of Dancing Coppers&mdash; it was said that if anyone unrighteous should touch the crown its sharp copper petals would cut a wound so deep that it could never heal. None could attest to whether or not the legends were true. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Eshkol sat at Vania&rsquo;s right hand where his Lord the king-to-be would sit, he shifted discreetly in his seat, anxious of the events that were to unfold and wary of whose presence he sat in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I gather The Tribunal today that I might seek their counsel,&rdquo; Rubella&rsquo;s voice booming, &ldquo;That they may guide The Mother of Stone and her humble servant, to a sentence firm and fair like the rock that our first mothers lay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen arose and each noble descended from their bench placing a knee on the floor and bowing their heads in unison, &ldquo;Bring before me my son of stone that with The Mother&rsquo;s wisdom I may judge and by his earthen sister&rsquo;s voice may speak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Those that bowed filled the coliseum with what Rubella could&rsquo;ve sworn sounded like the disembodied chant of rumbling stone itself, &ldquo;I advocate only what in stone is writ.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Rubella made a signal to the guards behind her and all the nobles stood as the hunched figure of the exorcist chained at both his wrists and ankles in thick steel chains was dragged up onto the stone stage at the centre of the coliseum. When the guards released their grip he fell to his knees and winced in pain as the rough stone dug into his calves, laid bare by the frayed and torn clothes he wore. Only the white cloak he wore held even a shred of dignity. The Queen wrinkled her nose in disgust at the sight of his vestments as though Rubella had brought her vermin from the sewers to judge.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Knelt before you, Enoch Cyrus, child of soil unknown and Saint of Nartsem.&rdquo; Rubella relished in the looks that the nobles exchanged as a sea of whispers descended upon The Tribunal.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is our counsel necessary, he&rsquo;ll hang won&#39;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Queen wishes to make a spectacle of it and so she shall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I remember when the reverend knelt right there, didn&rsquo;t take more than an hour afore The Queen sentenced him to the woods.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The Queen had seated herself and rested her head in a palm glaring at the nobles around her who were still stood, they found their seats almost immediately. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; Rubella started as she made her way before the stage so she could address both the exorcist and The Tribunal, &ldquo;Let the trial commence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
