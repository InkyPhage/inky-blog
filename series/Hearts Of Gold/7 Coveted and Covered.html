Her suite in fact took up the entire third floor split by a hallway that lead onto a spiral staircase to the fourth floor guarded by only the most diligent of the castle guard &mdash;those who Rubella was confident would fight till their dying breath for their Queen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella broke her fast on a decadent serving of cheese, bread, and wine (that the steward boy assured her was a favourite of Lord Yissachar himself). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had just finished her meal as the steward boy came back with two servants who gathered up the dirty crockery and hurried off through the servant&rsquo;s passages back to the kitchens, &ldquo;My lady, a message.&rdquo; The steward said as he fell to one knee bowing his head and putting a fist to his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rise, and speak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Her grace bids you come attend her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She seeks my council?&rdquo; Rubella&rsquo;s face contorted, puzzled why The Queen would seek her at such hours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She did not say, if I may though, she appears stressed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your insight, though unbidden, could well be correct,&rdquo; Rubella let out a sigh as she relaxed leaning back into the frame of the window, &ldquo;Alas it should do no good to sour her mood further, I shall dress at once, Inform Vania of my swift attendance.&rdquo; the boy simply nodded his head and left as silently as he came, one of Yissachar&rsquo;s greater gifts without a doubt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella donned her usual robes of office though she left her blade mounted above her desk in the study and her medallions sprawled across her dresser. The steward boy awaited her at the landing atop the spiral staircase, &ldquo;Her grace awaits you below where she bathes.&rdquo; The boy did well to lead her to the bath below the keep though she knew her way quite well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave us.&rdquo; The Queen commanded and the steward boy bowed and left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I beg your pardon my grace&mdash;&rdquo; The Queen cut her off, spinning round as a cascade of her long opal black hair swirled apart in the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I did not intend for you to bathe, though now I see it &mdash;smell it rather&mdash; you may be more in need of a bath than I, the stench of that place yet lingers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella fell backwards into a wooden bench that groaned ever so slightly under the impact she leant forward her hands clasped, &ldquo;I shall heed your words and freshen up later then.&rdquo; Rubella glanced at the petals strewn across the water: Roses, Violets, Orchids, and Lilies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen saw her and remarked, &ldquo;I fear these will not do.&rdquo; The Queen loosed an exasperated sigh and waded to the far edge of the bath alighting its steps, her handmaidens swarmed her with towels to dry her down and clothes to dress her as she made her way behind an ornate screen (yet another gift from Lord Yissachar) patterned with the stoneware goblet of Qumran and the Elderberry tree of Nartsem. Her handmaidens rushed out from behind the screen as though The Queen had shooed them like a flock of birds, hurriedly they made for the servants exits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The Queen herself appeared from behind the screen dressed in a palla fastened with brooches of copper, iron, silver, gold and steel each encrusted with jasper, pyrite, clear quartz, calcite, and aragonite. Each gem was chosen to represent past queens of Qumran, the gems themselves were sourced from The Mother&rsquo;s Tears &mdash;a small settlement near Rock Maw Tarn that bordered a gorge rich with precious stones some said from the tears of the land itself. The palla itself was a rich glossy dark-blue satin that seemed as though it drank up the very light itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen approached Rubella and sat beside her, leant forward with elbows rested on her knees. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder,&rdquo; The Queen whispered as though she feared the gods might hear her, &ldquo;Why . . . &nbsp;such a vile power exists.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella carefully nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are there gods, ones that truly wish to undo us, if so for what evil?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rubella took a deep breath and leant backwards placing her gloved hands on her knees, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">You</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are just, fair and righteous, the people of Qumran need not a god nor &mdash;dare I say it&mdash; a queen, for in you they have their mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen squeezed her eyes shut and reclined alongside Rubella turning her head to look her in the eyes, &ldquo;Thank you, not just for your service nor your words, but your friendship.&rdquo; For a second Rubella saw beneath Vania&rsquo;s mask, saw her genuine smile.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she walked about the courtyard Rubella spotted Bekarys giving out orders to the guardsmen an ever diligent and stern look drawn upon his face, &ldquo;Captain, a word if I may.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly my Lady.&rdquo; Bekarys gave some final orders to the guardsmen who gave a nod of confirmation before taking their posts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella stood side on to the captain and whispered into his ear, &ldquo;Was Meir at Roadway?&rdquo; Simple and straight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alas he was not, my men know not when he left the barracks but he has not been sighted north of Stonecut.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Damn, then he has likely made the crossing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fear not my Lady for my men are under orders to track him south.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I fear still, for in all likelihood he has crossed </span><span class="c2">The Spine</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;past which soldiers would be seen as a threat to Nartsemnian security.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have men stationed in The Shadowed Lands who could search for Meir under the guise of mercenaries.&rdquo; Rubella eyed the commander seeing his stalwart determination in those tough grey eyes, she inclined her head to order it done and Bekarys thrust a fist against his heart before inclining his head and taking his leave. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rubella spent the rest of the morn overseeing the soldier&rsquo;s training at the garrison. The courtyard alive with the slam of blunt steel against old wooden shields whose coat of arms were faded after countless blows they&rsquo;d endured.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Whenever Rubella visited the garrison the soldiers would fight fiercely to impress her, she heard it in the ring of their blows, actually there was much you could discern from sound alone. Rubella listened carefully; she heard amongst the uproar of cries the sharp whistle of a Halberd cleaving through the wind, the muffled clink of plate as the butt was thrust backward, then the crunch of dirt &lsquo;neath armoured boots as the soldier pivoted to meet an assailant&rsquo;s blow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The yard went silent as Rubella approached the soldier who had felled three of his peers with brutal efficiency and practised movements, &ldquo;Good sir, good sir!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;M-my Lady.&rdquo; The soldier stood attention his mailed fist slammed against his chest, head held high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At ease,&rdquo; A grin spread across Rubella&rsquo;s face as she observed the soldier, &ldquo;Tell me have you ever fought ahorse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nay my Lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well tomorrow you start, a cavalier we shall make of you yet!&rdquo; The soldier&rsquo;s face puffed with a mix of awe and pride as Rubella thumped him on the back, he barely managed to utter a thanks when she made way for the barracks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella spoke and dined for the afternoon with the generals though they had little more to report on than the occasional band of brigands. Their only neighbour, Nartsem, they had not fought since the battle of Lo&rsquo;Woam having managed to broker a kind of peace that Yissachar would further cement with his marriage to Vania. Much was said about Qumran&rsquo;s military: there were those who believed they needed little more of their men than to keep the peace in the land, then there were those who believed it was time for them to &lsquo;grace&rsquo; other shores. Rubella and those before her had seen to it that Qumran had honed its military and its justice &mdash;this was unlikely to change. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a message for Lady Rubella.&rdquo; An elder steward who had without a doubt been in service for many Dawns, his bow elegant as any.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella turned to her peers, &ldquo;If you envy me as vizier then let this change your minds, speak sir,&rdquo; She turned to face the steward as he rose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lord Eshkol wishes to speak with you my Lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well then, I shall tarry no longer.&rdquo; Rubella rose from her seat and waved for the steward to direct her to the stables where a mare had been prepared for her.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When she arrived at the study Eshkol was sat, &nbsp;his elbows braced on his knees and his hands clasped as if in prayer with his chin rested atop them, as she walked round the desk to take her seat he did not rise or greet her in any way. Candles were lit at sconces in each corner of the study dimly they lit the room darkened by the early falling sun, the red of Eshkol&rsquo;s whiskers ever more like tongues of fire as they shone in the candlelight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Last we spoke I fear it was not on the best of terms, may I make amends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Must we truly burn our temples when they give refuge to any and all who come upon them, preach only love and life?&rdquo; An unspoken answer to Rubella&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;On behalf of her grace I beg you forgive her ire, though I do not subscribe to such mysticisms you speak true of their value.&rdquo; Eshkol was still and silent with anticipation, &ldquo;however what her grace said yet stands, you need not burn but abandon the temples that way it might still serve refuge and time would see to its demolition instead.&rdquo; A hand covered Eshkol&rsquo;s face, clearly not the answer he&rsquo;d hoped for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What of our faith offends you, do our virtues not align with yours?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella clenched a fist, &ldquo;Virtue is not our qualm, thousands upon thousands were gored by those monsters that day by a man who claimed those self same virtues and faith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And yet you would have The Saint of Nartsem, our land&rsquo;s salvation, executed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He summoned a monster to kill, gods damned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Her grace may buy that but don&rsquo;t believe for a second that I would eat up those petty lies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You toe a dangerous line my friend, her grace is to be your Lord&rsquo;s Queen do </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;speak ill of her.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A soft rap of gauntleted hands sounded on the door and both turned to see Bekarys, &ldquo;I beg your pardon my Lord and Lady, but I&rsquo;ve a message for my Lady.&rdquo; Bekarys thrust a piece of parchment into Rubella&rsquo;s hand and left to let her read. Rubella carefully rebound the parchment and placed it on her desk. &ldquo;You wish to know the truth?&rdquo; Rubella&rsquo;s voice a cold calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella pulled out a drawer from her desk and produced the book wrapped in leather stuck with white wax seals. Eshkol&rsquo;s eyes widened and he uttered some Nartsemnian curse as his eyes danced over the seals in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I had my suspicions.&rdquo; Rubella began, &ldquo;since you were so keen to hear of the grimoire the other day, now you&rsquo;ve confirmed them.&rdquo; Eshkol made to reach for the book but in one swift motion Rubella picked up the letter opener she&rsquo;d slipped into her hand and swiped his. Blood began gushing out, the seal of grapes hissed and the red of Eshkol&rsquo;s blood spread through the white wax and melted it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Guards!&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Eshkol called out and two of his retinue along with Bekarys rushed into the room. Eshkol&rsquo;s guards drew their daggers and made for Rubella but Bekarys drew his blade before their faces to halt them, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing.&rdquo; He snarled. Gone was any composure he&rsquo;d shown before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Lord Eshkol I hereby accuse you of aiding the deaths of Qumran&rsquo;s honourable soldiers and perverting the Queen&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo; Rubella leant forward to whisper in the Lord&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve risked all of a land to save one man, now, let me hear you speak of love and </span><span class="c2">life</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo; </span></p><div><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p></div></body></html>
