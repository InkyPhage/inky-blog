Lo&rsquo;Woam bled into the soil of woodland that cordoned off the shadowed lands from Naruco, a strategic advantage that Thassi himself had put forward in the war against Nartsem and were it not for Rubella&rsquo;s countering stratagem it would have likely won Nartsem the war. Alas the battle of Lo&rsquo;Woam had been branded a tragedy and the victory at The Crossing had overshadowed Thassi&rsquo;s tactical genius. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch wondered how Daiya had fared, her father had offered Enoch her hand over that of a much wealthier lord after he saved her from the Ky&rsquo;Mura&mdash;an offer he had refused in order to pursue his duties. Considering Jorya for a moment Enoch commented, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve raised your son well Daiya, his sword-skill is unparalleled it would seem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Daiya smiled, &ldquo;Much to his own father&rsquo;s dismay, I had my late father&rsquo;s men-at-arms teach him, his own father lifted a blade but once.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The unspoken words were quite clear to him, though Daiya had inherited Gibbar&rsquo;s title when her brother inherited Manassess&rsquo; she still considered herself a provisional Baroch though any man or woman in her service would attest to her authority and wisdom, and in so far as her husband was concerned, &ldquo;Eshkol would much rather he bare the quill than the blade, do not misunderstand me I had him trained for his own protection&mdash;naught more.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Daiya noticed Jorya slump in his saddle as he heard those words, though her look was not one of disappointment or anger; just the understanding and forgiveness of a mother. Enoch grew uneasy all the same. </span><span class="c4 c6">If that last rider reached the keep . . . </span><span class="c1">No. It would have been nothing short of a miracle to survive the poison that Jorya had afflicted the man. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They neared a bend in the track as it curved around the outer edge of the woodland and Enoch could not help but behold what he saw for a moment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ahead was a large road that was easily six wagons wide and stretched to either end of his vision, Thassi rode back from the front of the column toward them, &ldquo;The Grand Road is quite the sight each and every time is it not Master Enoch?&rdquo; Thassi did not need to see Enoch nod to know that he agreed. The Grand Road was exactly as its moniker suggested, it was paved by pale cobble said to have been laid by the Eshall&rsquo;s daughter and the second Queen of Qumran, Ester. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the middle of the Grand Road that stretched between the neighbouring lands was the large city, their destination, of Bar&rsquo;Krans. Dwarfed only by Naruco itself Bar&rsquo;Krans was a hub of trade for many of the merchants who established themselves in Nartsem itself, the city was well fortified with tall and tightly packed stone walls that shonn dully, like a lizard&rsquo;s scales in the moonlight. Atop the walls the glow of half-helms, like the faint shimmer of waves crests as they roll, could be seen. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The soldiers did their patrol despite many days being joyfully peaceful with their current state of affairs. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thassi explained,&ldquo;Unlike our neighbor we rarely suffer brigands, our own people are docile with little reason to revolt when they have so much provided for them, a boon that our council brings us.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Though the Naruco chiefly ruled over Nartsem they formed a council with three Barochs and often heeded their advice. Not since its earliest days had Nartsem ever rebelled against its own government. Though the Barochs had land and duties divided among them their interest was vested solely in their appointed positions for the good of the whole realm. In this regard it was more a council of four lords all equal in power yet different in purpose. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In comparison the feudal system of their neighbors made nobles of many men and women who cared only to bolster their wealth and prosper their own estates, often at the expense of others. Nartsem was not without its own flaws however, the walls could only hold so many people and so clusters of houses formed a network of villages around Bar&rsquo;Krans. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The houses were often tall and leant over the streets, whitewashed stone with cedar frames so that they glowed brightly in the sunlight. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Meir scoffed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve simply a keep and they&rsquo;ve a whole bloody city.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; Asked Thassi, a prideful smirk on his face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all, I&rsquo;d rather not suffer the sight so much.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Put off by Meir&rsquo;s sour response Thassi turned back toward Enoch, &ldquo;A new Dawn is but days upon us, have you plans to celebrate Master Exorcist?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The last thing I planned was to purge the beast plaguing Wodenvile, Alas I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard those plans have gone awry.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Daiya, who had overheard, chirped up, &ldquo;Then you should join us in our revelry, after all there&rsquo;s little work for you here.&rdquo; Indeed Nartsem itself was almost pure of the wretched Anakim that terrorised its neighbors, Enoch had seen to it himself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would be unbecoming of me to enjoy comfort while there are those who suffer still.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yet it would do you better to have your head hanging between your shoulders than off them.&rdquo; Thassi countered. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Once my brother is married to Vania he will absolve you of any &lsquo;crime&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve put to your name, then you&rsquo;ll be free to pursue your calling.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Meir argued, &ldquo;To them he is a dead man, the dead are guilty of nothing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And to us he is very much alive, we should like to keep it that way as well.&rdquo; Daiya&rsquo;s glare told Meir enough. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They neared the outskirts where the Grand Road split into a dozen fingers that interlaced the villages. Already it was apparent they were preparing for some festival. Banners hung across the houses of the different Baroch&rsquo;s symbols: the violet Elderberry tree on a field of black that belonged to Yissachar, Thassi&rsquo;s white waves on a field of blue, Daiya&rsquo;s reddish brown wheel whose spokes were depicted as blades over a field of white, and at last the dark red of Eshkol&rsquo;s grapes on a field of pale green. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they joined one of the smaller roads Enoch noticed an old man call forth a boy. The boy was well dressed and listened eagerly as them man spoke to him but ran once he saw the column riding towards him, eyes widened in realisation. Weaving their way through the streets toward the wall that fortified Bar&rsquo;Krans they seemed to pursue the young boy. The boy noticing the riders hot on his tail called out to his friends in Nartsemnian that Enoch could not make out. They too ran ahead to whatever end. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch noticed yet more decorations, baskets of fruit and wreaths of flowers hanging from balconies. All about him were villagers setting up stalls in the market squares and what appeared to be wooden stages where various troupes would perform. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the air was festive, the people&rsquo;s cellars were so full of wine that the fragrance seeped through the floorboards and intermingled with the smoky scent of burning incense. Posters nailed to the many signposts they passed advertised everything from renowned Burandian musicians to eclectic Otterandian menageries. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gradually they slowed to a canter as they neared the gatehouse where, with a young girl at his side, a stout minstrel stood. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Puffing his chest outward the minstrel cleared his throat and it soon became abundantly clear to Enoch the purpose those children had served as the minstrel bellowed, &ldquo;Good folk of Bar&rsquo;Krans, make way for your sovereign Baroch the magnificent Lady Daiya of the crossroads!&rdquo; His Nartsemnian was so impeccably spoken that Enoch could feel the words rolling off the minstrel&rsquo;s tongue, &ldquo;The Baroch of Bar&rsquo;Tsi, a Lord most grand, Thassi!&rdquo; The muffled cheer that could be heard as the gate slowly creaked open went silent in awe as the minstrel roared, &ldquo;And finally, our very Saint of Nartsem, the venerable Enoch Cyrus!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The gates shuddered to a halt and the awaiting crowd cheered, Enoch felt their eyes dart between the nobles before them, some pointing to Jorya and remarking that the minstrel ought to have mentioned him but eventually every gaze hung from Enoch. Hands from the crowd reached out to touch Noah as if to ascertain that he was in fact real and not some figment of their imagination. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch admired the devotion of these people, spread about the villages there had been many small temples each with a slew of lit candles representing their gratitude to the life-giver for his greatest gift. Though they numbered few Enoch had noticed others wearing their vestments giving lessons to both the young and old who flocked to the temples seeking guidance. He did not, as many would have thought, feed his pride on their adoration but saw it instead as proof the life-giver had found his way into the lives of all these people filling them with love and life. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Making their way through the streets Enoch noticed that even amongst the cheer there were a sombre few among them, soldiers dressed in brigantine with a buckler showing Yissachar&rsquo;s sigil on its face. As they passed various taverns there would be ten or so sat outside sharpening their blades or stringing their bows. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thassi whispered to Enoch, &ldquo;My Lord&rsquo;s guard is here, Yissachar cannot be far, notice also that they only drink weak ale.&rdquo; Enoch turned to Daiya but her face did not betray any emotion other than the sweet smile she showed her people. Nevertheless he was sure she had noticed her brother&rsquo;s amassed retinue. The cheering crowds and young children chasing the column to get a glimpse at the riders began to whittle away as they got closer to the central plaza. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Normally the plaza would too be bustling with people browsing the stalls but it had been cordoned off and looked more like a shipyard as an elaborate array of wooden scaffolds was scattered across it. Dedicated craftsman scaled the scaffolds with planks of wood, hammers, nails to assemble a host of peculiar structures. Servants from the villa hurried down the steps to leave platters of fruits and tankards of ale for the workers, pausing only briefly to get a good look at the intriguing structures. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tearing his eyes from the intriguing work of the craftsmen Enoch fixed his gaze to the splendour of the villa before them, it was the newest building in the city and was a prime example of the genius of Otterandian engineering and architecture. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The courtyard was a glamorous thing with an immaculate row of stable stalls along the western wall from which the stable hands rushed out to take their mounts to be groomed and fed. In the middle of the courtyard there was a fountain-statue, a woman holding a great jar above her head from which clear water rushed out into a basin filled with exotic fish. Enoch felt the cold silky embrace of the water when he ran his hand through it as he passed, splashing the water over his face to cool off after a long ride. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Along the eastern wall ran a veranda with a beautifully mosaicked floor depicting a miniature world of wonderful creatures from the ferocious tiger to the serene dove. The northernmost corner of the eastern wall was blocked off by tall wooden screens behind which were the vila&rsquo;s baths where guests would unwind and relax in the marvel of the heated baths. Many rooms in the villa had hot air circulating beneath the floors such that many of the servants and guests would move about barefoot. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The northern wall was split in two by the Baroch&rsquo;s reception and office though the innermost part of the wall linked up with the balcony whilst the outermost part ascended into steps granting access to the terraced roof. The eastern and western walls too were terraced though the eastern ones rose to a second level to accommodate guest rooms, though crooked looking there was a kind of queer beauty to the asymmetry. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly the serenity was disturbed by the heavy thud of boots on the balcony above them, that the balcony could support such an enormous man was surely a feat of engineering in and of itself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a voice that could make even mountains shudder Yissachar spoke, &ldquo;Welcome home sister.&rdquo; Though his hair was the same black as Daiya&rsquo;s it was nowhere near as straight or smooth, a bushy beard of black littered with white strands of age covered his face yet matched the short black cloak with a white trim that he wore over his left arm, his sigil proudly emblazoned upon it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thassi fell into a bow, &ldquo;My Lord I did not know&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spare me your formalities Thassi, neither of us is so foolish to think we would not see the other.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thassi rose uneasily. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yissachar turned back toward his sister, &ldquo;Forgive me for intruding while you were gone,&rdquo; This time Yissachar was uneasy, &ldquo;but it was necessary that I make preparations&mdash;take precautions.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prepare for what?&rdquo; Daiya asked discarding any etiquette. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That I wish to discuss with the exorcist, in private.&rdquo; Both Thassi and Daiya were taken aback, for The Naruco to willfully hold back information from the council was unheard of, bold, and some might even say treasonous. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Distraught, Daiya asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Yissachar bellowed in reply, &ldquo;Because it concerns him and </span><span class="c4 c6">only</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;him, it is not a matter of state and I am therefore well within my right to privacy,&rdquo; Yissachar paused expecting further objections but the Barochs were silent, &ldquo;Good, exorcist come meet me up in the office.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He motioned behind him to the study on the first floor and Enoch, though uneasy, entered by the reception on the ground floor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The study took up the entirety of the second floor and was a great room with a desk at the furthest end nearest to the balcony with two rows of bookcases before it, cluttered with what Enock presumed were important documents amongst all the trinkets that Daiya and her father before her had seemingly collected from various ambassadors. Yissachar took his seat behind the desk running his fingers through his fringe in frustration then leaning on an elbow gazed blankly at the large painting that hung on the wall to his right. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch spotted a young Yissachar with his unmistakable messy black hair who came up to who he presumed to be his father, Gibbar&rsquo;s, side even at such a young age (indeed sat down Yissachar&rsquo;s gaze was level with Enoch&rsquo;s). With his hands rested on the shoulders of his own son Eshtaol stood grinning beside Gibbar, it was clear the two had been as much like brothers as their sons had become. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch heard hurried footsteps of a steward rush up the stairs but they were quickly dismissed with a wave of Yissachar&rsquo;s hand. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In truth I lied to them, this concerns Daiya as much as it concerns you.&rdquo; When Enoch did not interject he began to explain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not mince words, we received a letter from Qumran, the Queen herself.&rdquo; He pushed a piece of parchment across the desk and gestured for Enoch to read it. Enoch froze in horror. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Given the time between your supposed execution and the delivery of this letter it is clear that a rider must have escaped my nephew, even if by the skin of his teeth, and informed the Queen.&rdquo; Yissachar swallowed hard, &ldquo;It was Daiya who conspired to save you yet she did not foresee what it would cost her, you understand now why I had to keep this from her?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch nodded. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I will ride out with Thassi and my men to meet the Queen at The Crossing to parley, I am not about to offer you up like some lamb in exchange for Eshkol however, you will go to Bar&rsquo;Tsi and from there you will board </span><span class="c4 c6">Ualter&rsquo;s Wrath</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and convince the chieftain of the Burand&eacute;r to ally with us&mdash;take Jorya with you, but do not let him hear that his father is held captive!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a silence as Yissachar stared at Enoch, as if pondering whether he should reconsider but at last he said, &ldquo;You are dismissed, you shall depart on the morrow, Daiya&rsquo;s servants will pack provisions for you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enoch bowed and turned to leave. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;This was a hard decision for me to make, did I not owe you for saving my sister the decision would have been much easier, do not fail me.&rdquo;</span></p><div><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
