Meir was the only other soul who knew of the grimoire, the evidence that Enoch knew could have changed the case Rubella had made against him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you this side of The Spine? Why did you not testify at my tribunal?&rdquo; Enoch asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I seek refuge here in Nartsem, for I fear her men are after me, as such I did not present myself before her.&rdquo; Enoch sensed that Meir spoke in earnest, but sensed that he was hiding something in his words. </span><span class="c1 c5">&ldquo;Might be that they have &lsquo;stoneskin&rsquo; but their tongues are heavier in silver than any viper&rsquo;s blade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying the voice of his doubts no heed he continued his enquiry, &ldquo;Surely you would be safer in Naruco.&rdquo; Enoch paced thoughtfully, uneasy for he did not fully trust Meir.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir shook his head, &ldquo;There are few Qumranians in Naruco, I would draw too much attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch gestured behind him, &ldquo;The patrons in the tap room talked of you marrying the Innkeeper&#39;s daughter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir dismissed the point with a wave of his hand, &ldquo;No one will heed the ramblings of a drunkard, once Prish and I are married I shall be able to travel to Naruco.&rdquo; Enoch shot him a puzzled look, &ldquo;I promised as much to her father, with a wife I should arouse less suspicion and it would grant me the protection of her people.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marriage was sacred to Enoch, to his faith, a binding of love that remained steadfast even in this world of horrors, to see it tarnished by politics and scheming disgusted him. Enoch&rsquo;s disgust must have become apparent to Meir, for he made a retort at Enoch&rsquo;s unspoken protest, &ldquo;Think of me as you will exorcist, but I am the lesser of all the devils of this world, is it not sorcery that you yourself walk among us when you should surely be hanging in the woods?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Enoch&rsquo;s turn to dismiss the notion, &ldquo;It was no sorcery, I was saved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By that boy who accompanies you? Would you not call such a miracle sorcery?&rdquo; Meir in turn took his chance to be inquisitive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He is no simple boy, he is my warden.&rdquo; Enoch spoke firmly, since the display of power Jorya had shown and the way his blade had harmonised with his flames he had grown prideful of the young boy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What use has a holy man for a warden? Are you not supposed to handle conflict yourself, in a peaceful manner nonetheless?&rdquo; Meir questioned, the very notion ridiculous to him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I wish to change him by showing him </span><span class="c1">true </span><span class="c0">evil, teach him to protect the weak from the Anakim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Noble indeed, so you would make him The Saint&rsquo;s Warden,&rdquo; Meir raised his hands above his head as if straightening out a banner into which the title was stitched, marveling in mockery rather than awe at the thought, &ldquo;If you give a boy too many titles they become his downfall, I speak as one who was once such a boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Though unvirtuous of him Enoch had lost his patience, &ldquo;You did not lead me here for idle talk,&rdquo; He paused collecting himself, &ldquo;What does Vania want of you? Do </span><span class="c1">you</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have the grimoire?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Enoch thought was a revelation was shot down by Meir, &ldquo;I thought you smarter than this exorcist,&rdquo; In that moment Meir&rsquo;s laid back expression of a courtier stiffened into the wary man that had been hidden behind his hood, &ldquo;It is not the Queen I flee from, but her Vizier who I have no doubt you must have met.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch finished for him, &ldquo;Rubella.&rdquo; Her name spoken as though even its utterance was ill fortune.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It all started when Eilam and I uncovered documents that spoke of a book straight out of legend.&rdquo; His voice hushed though Enoch was certain that no one could possibly hear them over the uproar in the tap room. Meir leant in closer to Enoch who hung to each of his words, &ldquo;It is not known what the grimoire contains &mdash;stories of a time long before ours, dark magic that can bring back the dead, the rightful successor to The First Naruco&mdash; nonetheless the knowledge is both old and dangerous enough that whosoever wrote it sealed it away such that it could only be opened by the combined blood offering of three bloodlines, any other that would attempt to prise the seals from the book would die.&rdquo; Enoch recalled the feeling he had felt that day when he found the grimoire, as though someone had tried to run a blade down his spine and shuddered realising he had only been moments from joining the corpses that littered the floor. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir swallowed hard, &ldquo;I am one of such bloodlines, my blood is one of three that will grant Rubella whatever secrets are hidden in the grimoire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;How can you be so sure that it is Rubella?&rdquo; Enoch could believe that such a woman could be so devious but failed to see any reason to fully cast the blame on her, she had condemned him to death yes and refused to give him a fair tribunal but it seemed more likely that she had conspired </span><span class="c1">with </span><span class="c3">The Queen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Tell me this, why would The Queen be so &lsquo;cloak and dagger&rsquo; she fears the wrath of neither man nor woman east </span><span class="c1">and</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;west of The Spine.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; Meir&rsquo;s hands fell between his legs as he let the words sink in, they certainly held true.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch pressed his fingers to his temples, he knew very little of intrigue and for good reason, since he was young his duty had been to study the Anakim so that he and those who succeeded him could vanquish the dark terrors that plagued the lands. &ldquo;And you would beseech me to find this grimoire?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Meir chuckled softly, &ldquo;for a second time it would seem, after all, Rubella won&#39;t hunt a deadman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Dead or not if I walk into The Marble Keep they&rsquo;d surely bury me.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">If you walked cross The &nbsp;Spine you&rsquo;d likely be killed, the farmer in Roadway almost did kill you!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Though he did not welcome the voice&rsquo;s mocking return he had to admit it was right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Uncannily, as if Meir had heard his doubts he clicked his tongue, &ldquo;You need not go back to Qumran, haven&rsquo;t you heard what&rsquo;s happening at New Dawn?&rdquo; Enoch&rsquo;s furrowed brow gave Meir his answer, &ldquo;Yissachar and Vania are getting married! At the orchards of Bar&rsquo;Cythen no less, yes a retinue of halberdiers will accompany them but they should number far fewer than the guards at The Marble Keep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You think Rubella would have the grimoire with her?&rdquo; This all seemed too convenient to Enoch.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You think she would leave it behind? I should think Rubella would covet it as Vania would covet a babe.&rdquo; Enoch could see Meir was struggling not to cringe at the thought of his infamously wrathful Queen smiling as she clutched a newborn babe. Nevertheless Enoch understood that an heir was vital, no doubt why Vania was getting married in the first place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch stated simply, &ldquo;I decline.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir was taken aback, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I decline, I refuse,&rdquo; Enoch repeated, &ldquo;I refuse to risk my life for some . . . book, I have no time for such politics.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Politics?! Did you not hear me when I said </span><span class="c1">dark magic</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No such magic exists, it is only a fable, only the virtuous are able to bend this world&rsquo;s rules.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Your god is the life-</span><span class="c1">giver </span><span class="c0">is he not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch went stiff, &ldquo;tell me,&rdquo; he had Meir hanging on every word, &ldquo;what do you think life is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir stammered, &ldquo;I . . . I cannot truly say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is the beginning, the end, and everything in between, but never the prelude nor the epilogue, it is a force like fire yet unlike a flame once it sputters out it cannot be re-lit.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;You cannot give life to the unliving.&rdquo; A silence passed between them, a mix of awe and shock at Enoch&rsquo;s response danced upon Meir&rsquo;s face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Weary and exhausted Enoch left the fool behind him and set out to find his own room. Prish happened upon him as he entered the hallway and beckoned him toward a door but two rooms over from Meir, where Jorya&rsquo;s had creaked the door to Enoch&rsquo;s room made only a soft groaning noise. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room was certainly fit for a Lord, it was dressed with the finest carpets the Innkeeper could find and the tables beside his bed and by the window were bedecked with fancy cloth whose edges had been so delicately tasselled. Despite the lavish fabrics that adorned the furniture it was the rich smoky incense that Enoch took pleasure in&mdash;not because he knew it would have been costly&mdash;but because it reminded him of home.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Her hands cradled at her front and her back straight Prish asked, &ldquo;Is everything to your liking my Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to do for the night I suppose,&rdquo; Enoch was not overly fond of comfort yet he had to keep up the charade a little longer, though he must have spoken too loudly for Prish went frantic all of a sudden looking around the room for mistakes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is the incense too much my Lord?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no, it&rsquo;s fine, just . . . let me get some rest.&rdquo; Prish nodded and walked steadily from the room then turned and bowed before backing out the doorway, Enoch closed the door behind her and let his cloak and robes fall to the floor. He let his feet give way, falling forward onto the soft featherbed, using the last of his energy to will the lights in the dimly glowing sconces to finally flicker out.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The harsh ringing of the daybreak bell stirred Enoch from his sleep, a deep sleep at that. Between the stables at that Inn in Roadway and the dungeon of The Marble Keep he had not slept well in days. Some wicked part of him supposed he&rsquo;d earnt the luxury of a featherbed, one that he&rsquo;d thoroughly ruined. The flames had cleansed him and Jorya of any of the Anak&rsquo;s remains that might of clung to them but his own blood and the muck that coated him from head to toe had besmirched the beautiful sheets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lord of mud looks like.&rdquo; Enoch muttered whilst scanning the room, he spotted the bag that Jorya had packed for him. Heaving himself off the mattress he stumbled towards the bag and loosened the draw strings removing the box of components etched with the sigil of The Naruco upon its lid. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Enoch set the box aside and marveled at what lay below; folded emerald green clothes with a teal lining, a tunic, a pair of breeches, and a cloak atop which there was a note that read: </span><span class="c1">To match your eyes</span><span class="c0">. Enoch knew for certain Jorya had not packed this. Behind the note there was a silver clasp in the shape of an all too familiar beast, The Ky&rsquo;Mura. The beak was silver-gilt along with its feathers and mane and it was encased in a bright silver ring of fire. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a good while Enoch was mesmerised but then the ringing of the bell pulled him from that silent trance, he hurried to wash himself and change into his clean clothes briskly walking down the hallway to the taproom. He found Jorya merrily breaking his fast as if the ale he&rsquo;d drunk the day before was less than a fleeting memory. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Enoch sat opposite Jorya. Prish had a tray laid in front of him immediately, a ceramic bowl filled with porridge and beside it a number of pots of berries, yoghurt, salt, syrup, and honey. Enoch gave Prish a grateful nod and she once again bowed before walking back to her father&rsquo;s side. The other patrons peered over at their table, their service consisted of a simple half-full bowl and a pot of salt, their eyes met the pin at Enoch&rsquo;s cloak and they turned back to their own bowls and miserably spooned what little they had into their mouths. Guilt weighed him down, turned his stomach as he sweetened his porridge with honey. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the hallway Meir stepped out turning immediately to Prish and planting a kiss on her outstretched hand then glanced around the room, Enoch felt his gaze hang at their table for a second. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meir took his fiance aside for a second and Enoch overheard him say, &ldquo;Darling, would you be so kind as to fetch our guests some condiments.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prish gave Meir a confused look and turned to her father who had overheard, &ldquo;With all due respect I simply cannot afford to give out that kind of service to all,&rdquo; The Innkeeper spoke softly nearer the end of his response &nbsp;but it did not stop the patrons from turning to look.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meir simply grinned and began to tsk then with a thud and rattle of coppers he made sure all could hear he slammed a pouch of copper coins on the counter and addressed the room, &ldquo;This morn we shall </span><span class="c1">all </span><span class="c0">eat like Lords!&rdquo; There was an uproar as the patrons cheered and maids came to each table with the same array of condiments they had brought to Enoch and Jorya. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each time Meir passed a patron he would exchange words with them and embrace them, when he walked past Enoch he leant into his ear and whipered, &ldquo;It is the little things they remember best.&rdquo; He nodded at Jorya who returned the gesture with a smile then Meir sat at a table with Prish and the two talked and laughed between mouthfuls of berries yoghurt and porridge. Enoch noticed the Innkeeper who stood silently rejoicing at the merriment before him, his eyes watering ever so slightly as he saw the sweet smile on his daughter&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is it you wish to take me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To Bar&rsquo;Krans, my mother&rsquo;s seat.&rdquo; Jorya replied with a mischievous grin, a stark contrast to the plain brigandine and breeches he had dressed in, the only thing that remained of Jorya was the silver sword sheathed over his back, a blade whose point was so sharp it had to be held in a half scabbard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Very funny, I meant where are you taking me </span><span class="c1">today.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Indeed we cannot set off today, we must first stock up on provisions and the like, we shall cut through the woods &mdash;fewer eyes means fewer mouths&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but </span><span class="c0">I also wish to show you that there are still flowers that grow in full shade.&rdquo; Enoch pondered Jorya&rsquo;s cryptic statement a moment as he followed the boy who walked merrily ahead of him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Each passersby would glance at Jorya&rsquo;s sword as it bounced off his back at made a high pitched</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;clink</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as it hit the steel studs in his armour. </span><span class="c1">So much for keeping a low profile. </span><span class="c0">The pale sun and half-scabbard did a good service of making the well-polished blade a harsh sight, cloaking the best parts of the etchings on the blade&rsquo;s face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few eyes went to Enoch&rsquo;s clasp, likely to discern which noble he was, legend had spared him discovery for if anyone had heard of the Ky&rsquo;Mura none had seen it and legend had (as legend does) bastardized its form: a fire breathing scaled horror, a shadowy ten foot tall ogre, or even a shade of The Queen Vania herself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eventually they arrived at a house much like every other that they had walked past though Enoch knew that appearances could be deceiving, he had the boy before him to thank for that. Jorya rapped twice on the door and then paused and rapped thrice, the door opened and a tall dark skinned man beckoned them in. The man was well built and only a stubbly black beard graced his face and his eyes were an intense bronze brown, he turned to Jorya and spoke in a thick foreign accent, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jorya, who is this man that you have brought to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He is none other than the venerated saint Enoch Cyrus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The tall man fell onto one knee (though he still more than a foot taller than him) and beheld him, sized him up as if measuring him for a new tunic, those fierce eyes were now filled with joy and an astonished smile. Enoch shot Jorya a look, </span><span class="c1">I did not think we could speak so freely of ourselves.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then as though he had seen Enoch&rsquo;s doubt he explained, &ldquo;This is Dubaku a great friend of mine and my father, he is a sculptor from the Otterand.&rdquo; Enoch looked around the room properly and saw that Dubaku&rsquo;s house was one large open space of desks piled with wooden sculptures of warriors, animals, fortresses and all manor of deftly carved statues. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dubaku noticed where Enoch was looking and pointed to various miniatures that littered the place naming them &nbsp;and all their intricate features, Enoch however could not hear him for he was mesmerised by the wooden world before his eyes, the dedication that had practically breathed life into these motionless figures. &ldquo;I cannot believe that I am finally seeing you.&rdquo; Enoch turned back to Dubaku, &ldquo;Singers have written songs of you, a statue erected in your honor, yet I am seeing you in the flesh, and truly none of them do you justice!&rdquo; Enoch often tried to remain stoic in light of flattery but a smile managed to creep across his lips, &ldquo;Would that I had your word I would like to try my hand at a model of yourself, as I have done for Jorya.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dubaku pointed to a statue of the boy seated in a tall oak chair with a sword across his lap and two shoeden kait pacing around his seat. &ldquo;It is no place of mine to tell you what you can and cannot craft, though I need none of these songs and statues, I am still but a man.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dubaku did not wait for Enoch to finish as soon as he had heard what he wanted he went to a desk and started to draft designs. Enoch paced about the room and took a closer look at the statues until his eye caught something. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So what do you think of Dubaku&rsquo;s work? One would think the man a smith not a sculptor just by looking at him but he is truly good, for generations my fami&mdash;&rdquo; Enoch hushed him with a finger at his mouth and pointed between the statues and through the window to the scene outside where the Qumranian sellsword captain who they&rsquo;d called &lsquo;Missy&rsquo; was stood with a hand braced above her head against the wall of the house opposite her, &ldquo;They are too far for me to glean anything, I can only see a glimpse of what might be another woman&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo; Enoch withdrew his palm from the floor to reveal a small strand of copper wire that he had run through the ground, he then motioned for Jorya to cup his hands and listen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;. . . and you are sure?
