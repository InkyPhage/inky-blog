The soldiers still very much in shock had no time to act as this cloaked figure slipped behind the soldier and wrapped his arms tightly around his neck. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other soldiers began to mount their horses and draw their halberds hoping to run down this mysterious assailant. With a violent jerk, the figure pulled his arms apart the soldier&rsquo;s neck snapped with a brutal crack of bone and the final rasping breath of air before his life left him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soldiers had circled their mounts and sped to a full gallop with their halberds angled at the cloaked figure&rsquo;s head whilst he crouched rifling through the dead soldier&rsquo;s pockets. Restrained there was naught Enoch could do to help either the cloaked figure or the soldiers that he might kill. It pained Enoch as he bore witness to the slaughter that would ensue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cloaked figure rose cursing in Nartsemnian as two of the soldiers attempted to cleave his head from his shoulders as they rode by, the figure ducked with seconds to spare and the halberds caught his cloak ripping it from his shoulders and throwing him through the grass as his boots dragged up the dirt slamming him into the tree next to Enoch. Enoch saw that this cloaked figure was a boy of little more than fourteen Dawns whose face showed sharp thin cheekbones a furrowed brow of fiery red hair along with a head of shoulder height loosely worn red hair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again the boy rose and stepped forward, the mounted soldiers began to slow and circle him their halberds ever at the ready. The boy reached for his sword behind him a silver blade that wailed as he drew it from his scabbard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The blade had drawings of panthers and Nartsemnian script engraved into its beveled face. Enoch understood these words: </span><span class="c3">Shoeden Kait,</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">for it was the name of the beast whose deadly form was displayed upon the blade. As the cry of the blade left the air the thundering of hooves filled the wood again as they rode in one by one to fell the boy who Enoch heard utter, &ldquo;They say you cannot draw blood from a stone.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The boy readied himself, feet perpendicular, blade held behind his back, a hand at his hip where he had a menacing array of daggers. The first soldier leant out of his saddle to swipe low at the boy&rsquo;s legs but the axehead found nothing but blades of grass to cleave, the boy nimbly leapt over the halberd and pulled the already off-balance soldier from his saddle to the ground. Raising the point of the blade to deliver the finishing blow he drove it through the man&rsquo;s throat, finding the gap in the armour between the helm and gorget, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A Myth it seems,&rdquo; said the boy as he wrenched the blade out and readied himself for the next riders&rsquo; attacks. Two of the riders came at the boy slowing to a canter as they strafed him attempting to harry him with a flurry of blows. A wicked hymn of silver and steel filled the air as blades clashed; A heavy swing countered by a deft parry, a quick jab answered by a fierce riposte that took out one of the riders eyes. The blinded rider screamed swinging his halberd wildly, desperate to land a vengeful hit on the boy. Instead by some cruel twist of fate his steel connected with the shoulder of the other rider between his shoulder guard and corslet. The boy flipped the blade in his hand so that the blade ran parallel with the back of his forearm then took a step up to poise himself on the pole of the halberd that had formed a bridge between the two riders. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch swore the blade moved with superhuman speed as afterimages formed in the air where the light flickered off the blade&rsquo;s silver edge &mdash;brought back over a shoulder, thrust through the back of one rider then swiftly redrawn and plunged into the blinded rider&rsquo;s neck each time the blade found just the right gap to slip between to deal a finishing blow&mdash; the boy jumped backward and turned to look over his shoulder. The last rider reared his mount to suddenly turn away from a charge making to flee the woods posthaste, cursing the boy dropped his sword, drew a dagger and vial from his belt smashing the vial against the blade so that the poison would soak it. With almost supranatural reflex the boy threw the dagger, hitting the fleeing rider in the back of his lower leg where his greaves could not protect him, yet still he rode. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; huffed the boy as he wiped his hands with a cloth he produced from a pouch in his belt, &ldquo;He won&#39;t make it so far as the keep even if he doesn&#39;t lame his horse first.&rdquo; His blade whined as he sheathed it over his back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch noticed the boy&rsquo;s black doublet in more detail as he approached, the rays of light that broke through the canopies illuminating the embossed thread that showed both the fierce image of the panther and the sigil of Nartsem&rsquo;s Naruco. Having found the key to his shackles amongst the bodies of the riders he had slain the boy unbound him and helped him to his feet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jorya, at your service master exorcist.&rdquo; The boy had clearly not seen the look of horror on Enoch&rsquo;s face as he wore such a wicked grin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jorya . . . what have you done,&rdquo; Enoch looked for words in his hazy thoughts, &ldquo;You need of only unbound me and I could&rsquo;ve restrained these men, that last rider, you might have spared him!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Had I spared that last rider he would have brought news of me to the keep, a boy or fiery hair and silver blade, they chose death the moment they took hold of steel.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can you smile at this? This is slaughter.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I take no pleasure in taking lives master, come dusk I shall beg forgiveness but we shan&rsquo;t tarry for your steed awaits us at the edge of the wood and without your flame the Lycans that prowl these woods will give us much trouble,&rdquo; Jorya began to make his way then turned to beckon Enoch follow him, &ldquo;Come master I shall lead the way.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enoch followed his head still abuzz with questions, &ldquo;How did you find Noah?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As a child my mother told me stories of you, with great detail did she describe you ride a top a brilliant grey stallion from Hopse Vry to the fields outside Bar&rsquo;Krans.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">More Nartsemnian; Hopse Vry, </span><span class="c3 c4">House of Fire</span><span class="c3">, the greatest temple of the life-giver&rsquo;s faith, Bar&rsquo;Krans, </span><span class="c3 c4">Branch of the crossroads</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;where a Baroch (one of the lords on the Naruco&rsquo;s council) governed from however Bar&rsquo;Krans was but one of three </span><span class="c3 c4">&lsquo;branches&rsquo; </span><span class="c3">Bar&rsquo;Cythen and Bar&rsquo;Tsi, </span><span class="c3 c4">copper </span><span class="c3">and </span><span class="c3 c4">sea </span><span class="c1">respectively were too governed by their own Baroch. Enoch began to connect the dots, &ldquo;Daiya, Daiya is your mother?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes master, she remembers you fervently, and as soon as she got word that you were in trouble she sent me across The Spine that I might steal you away in the dead of night, alas . . .&rdquo; He did not finish, clenching a fist and gritting his teeth as he continued to lead the way, maybe the boy truly did regret his transgressions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A little longer and they came across Noah who diligently awaited his master&rsquo;s return. Jorya produced a mask for the horse that would stop him from seeing or scenting the rotting flesh, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make our way back through the woods by horse, though he&rsquo;s quite fearless I don&rsquo;t want to risk him bolting.&rdquo; Indeed Noah did not seem nervous even with the aged sepia bones that hung from the trees at the edge of the wood in sight of him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;There&#39;s a mountain path through The Spine that we&rsquo;ll lead him along by foot, father said soldiers used it to slip our defenses in an attempt to sack Naruco once.&rdquo; Those new to Nartsem were often puzzled by the multiple meanings words could bare, Naruco meant &lsquo;</span><span class="c3 c4">root</span><span class="c3">&rsquo; and referred to both the capital of Nartsem where </span><span class="c3 c4">The</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Naruco had his seat, from which he would rule with the aid of his Barochs &mdash;</span><span class="c3 c4">branches</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the tree that the council formed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was past noon before they ate as neither could stomach any food whilst the putrid stench of decaying flesh hung in the air, it was not until they had ridden through the woods and made way along the mountain path that Jorya handed Enoch some provisions that he&rsquo;d packed in Noah&rsquo;s saddlebags along with hay for the horse to eat and a delicately handcrafted box of components should Enoch need his magic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Last I saw the guards were bartering over who should take Noah, I could&rsquo;ve sworn I saw a general deliberating his use as a war horse.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish I could tell you that I stole him on the morrow leaving naught but a cloud of dust and dirt behind me, truth is I diced for him, men watching over him were game and the dice kept hitting double sixes, soldiers couldn&rsquo;t pay the winnings so I told them to throw in the stallion.&rdquo; Noah whinnied at the comment as if in disgust and the two sniggered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find a blade like that?&rdquo; Enoch asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Found?&rdquo; Jorya snorted, &ldquo;I smithed her myself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why the panther then?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ah, when I was maybe but four Dawns I was playing out in the orchards at </span><span class="c3">Bar&rsquo;Cythen</span><span class="c1">, one came down from the hills and lay amidst the trees in the shade.&rdquo; Jorya forced a grin as he continued, &ldquo;Course I was scared as a mouse so I panicked and ran, father was making a count of the orchards that day and found me in tears and asked me to show him &lsquo;the beast&rsquo; when I brought him there he stroked the panther, scratched it behind the ears and sent it on its way!&rdquo; Jorya clicked his tongue and wore a wide grin, &ldquo;After that he told me: you were right to be scared, a shoeden-kait is as soft of foot as the wind on the grass yet it cuts deep and quick.&rdquo; Jorya unsheathed the blade and it let out a muted song as it rubbed against the scabbard, &ldquo;One day an apostle stopped by Bar&rsquo;Cythen, taught me that a symbol had strength, that life by design was magic, just the image of a beast could turn blades as well as any breastplate.&rdquo; Enoch nodded slowly in understanding, he had himself never used a bladed weapon of any kind for he detested drawing blood that was red, yet there was a certain majesty to the intricate metalwork of Jorya&rsquo;s blade. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They reached a part of the path where they began to make a turn across The Spine with another mountain closely packed against them so that the path was significantly narrower, almost as though it were carved out by some giant&rsquo;s hand was a small cave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It grows dark master, let&rsquo;s rest here for the night.&rdquo; the sun slunk behind the clouds as it made its descent into the horizon almost as if it had darkened at Jorya&rsquo;s behest. Jorya did not have time to pack a bedroll for either of them so they would have to rest their heads against their packs and lie on the flattest slabs of stone they could find.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take first watch, I daresay you could use the rest.&rdquo; Exhausted though he was he could not sleep, not for the hard ground beneath him but the thoughts that plagued him. </span><span class="c3 c4">&ldquo;Their blood stains you just as much as it does the boy, your magic is a blessing, not a brace.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;What Enoch heard next moved him &mdash;banished his doubts from his surface thoughts, drowning them&mdash; Jorya began to sing in a sonorous yet soft voice, a hymn all too familiar to Enoch:</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c3 c4">O Light of Life, doth the dark sky bejewel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embrace my body till my ash burns cold</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn your image, embers, white light shall I extoll!</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c5 c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Light of Love, the cruel do cast aside</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me your passion burning ev&rsquo;r bright</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I could in those, lost or lowly, your ardor relight!</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c5 c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Light of Love and Life, a never ending fountain of renewal</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the eerie darkest corners shall I cast</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c3 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That force, fiery forg&rsquo;d blade, pow&rsquo;r unsurpassed!</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c3 c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Jorya had finished the last verse Enoch got up to sit across from him and join him in his final words, the harmony of their voices a solemn whisper of praise in the still and cold night breeze offset by the sparks spat out by the firewood drifting past their faces. Jorya opened his mouth to speak letting out only a hollow breath before he bit back whatever words he had meant to say. Wordless Enoch bowed his head, not to push, but to tell the boy he could confide in him, that he would help shoulder whatever burdened the boy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;My mother taught me, those words, that even should I stray the light would always guide me back on the path.&rdquo; He looked up to Enoch a sorrow written on his face, &ldquo;And though I regret it, I . . . I cannot deny how right it felt.&rdquo; Abruptly Jorya stood a hand at his chest, &ldquo;But Gods were it not for you, the people in my homeland would be dead, ravaged by the dark horrors </span><span class="c3 c4">you </span><span class="c3">expelled, </span><span class="c3 c4">I </span><span class="c1">wouldn&rsquo;t be here had you not saved my mother from the Ky&rsquo;Mura.&rdquo; He sat again hanging his head between his knees, &ldquo;So for all I regret, repent, given a second chance I would do the same again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a moment of silence as Jorya&rsquo;s confession sank in before Enoch himself rose, &ldquo;look over yonder, the land of stone.&rdquo; Jorya turned to look over the horizon as Enoch continued, &ldquo;even in the midst of uncultivable land trees grow tall, fields bring harvest, wildflowers bloom and from these very mountains resplendent gems are born.&rdquo; Jorya sat still in awe, &ldquo;And for all that you might damn them they care, love, even when they stray the one thing that puts them back on the path of light is love.&rdquo; Enoch shook Jorya&rsquo;s shoulder to draw his gaze back into the exorcist&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;Light shines in darkness just as love burns in hate, don&rsquo;t entertain right and wrong, live and love on.&rdquo; Enoch patted the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Get some rest, I shall wake you for your watch.&rdquo; With that Jorya lifted himself from where he sat and wearily made his way to his pack and fell asleep almost immediately. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Enoch sat and looked up to the stars the constellations came into view, pondering himself the words he&rsquo;d taught Daiya what seemed many Dawns ago, and as if he could never be free of them his doubts rose again: </span><span class="c3 c4">&ldquo;You were a fool to let her go.&rdquo;</span></p><div><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c8 c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
