The dungeons were as much a death sentence as they were a prison, situated close to the sewer system that ran beneath Qumran. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The things I do for justice,&rdquo; she uttered casting a glance backward at her companion, a burly man dressed in a tattered leather tunic that struggled to conceal the rings of mail he wore underneath. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The man walked heavy of foot his soles hammering the cobblestone floor as they walked. In his right hand he carried a dull and bare steel great sword that wafted the haze back and forth as it swung. Over his left shoulder he had a dirty leather sack with frayed drawstrings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Though she too wore a tunic it was tailored from a richer burnished-vermilion silk hidden &lsquo;neath the folds of her heavy leather cloak, the hood of which cast a long shadow through the middle of her face. Only a single strand of her golden hair hung from her forehead as the rest was braided and tied in a bun at the back of her head as though she wore a crown of golden rope. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Much like her companion she was sure-footed but her raised heel sounded a sharp clack as it thumped the paving, turning the heads of curious prisoners who conversed amongst themselves in low murmurs that they thought others could not hear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">She marched forward with the rugged sell sword at her heels, the dull grey of his eyes a stark contrast to her defiant chestnut brown. Her eyes darted from cell to cell squinting at the prisoner&rsquo;s faces then every now and again returning to the messy sketch slipped into her notebook. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">She was about to pass the cell when his heavy hands prodded her shoulder, she swung around ready to yell at the oaf but her gaze first met the hunched figure coated from head to toe in grime tucked away in the corner of his cell. She looked down at her notebook one final time and matched the features of his face: green eyes, a short black head of hair, slender skull and a thin frown. She slammed the notebook shut and pocketed it in the folds of her cloak then took a step towards the tall iron bars of the cell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;How the mighty have fallen.&rdquo; She sneered accenting her voice with a tomboyish growl, &ldquo;It is Enoch isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She waited calmly for the figure to reply but his eyes remained fixed at his feet as his fingers fiddled with the fringe of his garb &mdash; all that remained of his holy garments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Speak when yer spoken to.&rdquo; Spat the sell-sword as he too brought his face close to the bars. The figure remained silent. The next few moments may have seemed quick to onlookers, but She found it tediously slow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Lady Rubella, Vizier to The Queen, speaks to you so </span><span class="c0 c6">you&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;speak back!&rdquo; Yelled the sell sword as he began to swing the flat of his great sword through the air and at the bars of the cell. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">A sigh was all Rubella could manage. She drew a thin blade with jagged steel teeth from the folds of her cloak and intercepted the sell sword&rsquo;s blade, he staggered back dumbfounded as the sound of grating metal stung his ears and watched as his blade was ripped in two. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella&rsquo;s hood swung back as she followed through, the motions bringing her sword-breaker across her front and resting it on her left hip. A prisoner in the cell across the corridor scrambled on his hands and knees attempting to reach for one of the pieces of steel. Rubella spotted him and drove her heel into the back of his hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella cast a deadly gaze over her shoulder at the bewildered sell sword, &ldquo;It is a good thing I employ your arm and not your sword </span><span class="c0 c6">Master Zacharus</span><span class="c2 c0">, or am I to fear that too is as brittle as your blade?&rdquo; Some hushed sniggers could be heard from nearby cells as Zacharus&rsquo; face was flushed beetroot red. &ldquo;Need I remind you what happens to those with loose tongues, I&rsquo;d of preferred it if not every man and woman in Qumran knew who I was &mdash; precisely why I chose to wear a cloak and picked a sell sword over a royal retinue,&rdquo; She jeered, her hand deftly returned the sword-breaker to the shroud of her cloak and then beckoned him with a patronizing duck of her chin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Now if it pleases you, the sack.&rdquo; Zacharus complied and threw the sack at her feet his cheeks still scorched bright red.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;You really wish to test me, luckily my patience is nowhere near as short as yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Adamant Zacharus turned back to Enoch&rsquo;s cell and planted his forehead against the cold bars as if hoping that would cool his embarrassment, but he simply resorted to glowering at Enoch who scarcely looked as if he had noticed Zacharus at all &mdash; if he did his face did not betray it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella leant over and rifled through the sack until she found the neatly packed wooden box and presented it in front of the bars, &ldquo;Dove&rsquo;s feathers, Pomegranate seeds, Wire, and bread.&rdquo; She paused a moment after she listed off the last item to see the look on Enoch&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;A pouch of a few coppers and a copious amount of hay, save for the last I&rsquo;d say this quite clearly points to one thing.&rdquo; Again she scanned his face awaiting a reaction but her only reward was his blank stare. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an exorcist.&rdquo; She raised a brow and spread her arms, this time she got a reply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Said Enoch forcing the words through his teeth as he swung his eyes away from her face once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">She slid her arms behind her back and interlocked her fingers as she began pacing in front of the cell keeping her gaze fixed on the exorcist that sat in front of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What brought you to Qumran, surely you did not believe its people would welcome you with open arms?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Regardless of what people think of me my mission does not change,&rdquo; Enoch replied detached as he swatted a fly with cold and calm precision, &ldquo;Where evil walks I will pursue it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella chuckled, &ldquo;How poetic,&rdquo; abruptly she spun on her heel and continued her pace, &ldquo;Then you would pursue the shadows of every man and woman for what it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo; Enoch was silent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella sighed, &ldquo;I digress, I assume then that it was dedication that pulled you from Nartsem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;How do y&mdash;&rdquo; Began Enoch but Rubella interrupted him before he could finish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Contrary to what my companion would have you believe I have those who bring me whispers,&rdquo; Rubella&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she stopped to stare at Zacharus, &ldquo;Otherwise my lips would be little more use to the Queen than those of a serving girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella watched as Enoch&rsquo;s gaze began to track her, curious of what other secrets she might know. This was good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The Saint of Nartsem, a flame that cuts through the heart of darkness.&rdquo; A smile graced Rubella&rsquo;s face only to be torn by her furrowed brow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Here we have a different saying: The devils cloaked in lies.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Once again Rubella resumed her pace, &ldquo;Bekarys tells me that you were employed by Eilam and Meir &mdash;certainly rare for anyone from the capital to employ an exorcist&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; Rubella watched Enoch carefully looking for any deviation in his response, &ldquo;Even fate brought him to you moments afore you would be skewered, or so I am told.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Enoch&rsquo;s stoic fa&ccedil;ade was crumbling, blotched with a vibrant irritation as he listened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella continued, &ldquo;But instead you summoned an Anak to disp&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time it was Enoch&rsquo;s turn to interrupt, &ldquo;No, even if I wanted to I </span><span class="c0 c6">can&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;summon Anakim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Piqued, Rubella tilted her head ever so slightly and asked, &ldquo;If that is so how do you explain this hundred-legged-horror that the guardsmen claim to have sighted?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;It hid below the sand of the cove and surfaced once, once Eilam set foot on the beach.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubella was puzzled, though he appeared truthful she sensed a sorrow in his voice, she dismissed the thought almost as soon as it dawned upon her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This I find hard to believe, the guards tell me that they have surveyed the area extensively,&rdquo; For a moment she paused and entertained a thought, &ldquo;If you came to Qumran seeking to purge it of evil then surely you would have known that there </span><span class="c0 c6">was</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;evil there . . .&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Her thoughts trailed as she observed the change in his demeanour. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Enoch answered her unspoken question, &ldquo;I . . . I knew there were Anakim &mdash; six of them &mdash; but when we arrived there were none to be seen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella walked right up to the bars of the cell and folded her arms as she spoke to him, &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t think to share this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Even If I did they wouldn&rsquo;t ha&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella nonchalantly finished his sentence, &ldquo;Listened,&rdquo; A heavy sigh escaped her lips and she shook her head, &ldquo;Oh how you bore me exorcist, you claim to pursue evil in the face of prejudice yet you would refuse a man the premonition that might save his life?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Enoch fell silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Before me is a man, a man who acts like he is still the same mischievous boy who practised spell work behind his father&rsquo;s back many Dawns ago.&rdquo; Though she could not make out his words she knew that Enoch cursed his carelessness. All of a sudden Enoch&rsquo;s eyes widened in remembrance, &ldquo;the grimoire!&rdquo; He exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Surprised Rubella backed away from the bars of the cell, &ldquo;Grimoire, what grimoire do you speak of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I had it with me, your guards, they&rsquo;ll have it.&rdquo; He stood running fingers through his hair smearing it with grime in the process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The guards relinquished naught but your components and feed for your mount.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;No. That can&rsquo;t be true . . . the catacombs!&rdquo; Shouted Enoch getting desperate by the second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think that this dungeon has begun to take its toll on your mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Ask Bekarys, he saw it, the doorway a-and the steps, the steps down to the catacombs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Again, Bekarys&rsquo; men have surveyed the area </span><span class="c0 c6">countless </span><span class="c2 c0">times, you&rsquo;ll find nothing but rock and sand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;But it has to be &nbsp;. . . wait, the note, I found a lycan carrying a note.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What drivel is this?&rdquo; Dismayed Rubella furrowed her brow at the maddened exorcist that stood before her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;To all who read this, her majesty decrees: find the fruits and return them unto me.&rdquo; Recited Enoch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella leaned back into the bars of the cell and left her final remark, &ldquo;The worst kind of devil, is the one who believes his </span><span class="c0 c6">own </span><span class="c2 c0">lies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella ascended the dungeon steps and took a deep breath of fresh air once she reached the alley, a carriage awaited her with rich velvet curtains embroidered with the emblem of Qumran&rsquo;s royal family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">She turned to Zacharus and handed him a large pouch of copper from her cloak, &ldquo;In hopes that you would use it to buy a better sword, from a proper forge where the blades are densely packed with steel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Once she had spoken her mind Rubella turned from the sell sword and alighted the carriage unfastening her dirty cloak and casting it aside as she took her seat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I admire your diligence, though I fear the stench of that place will linger.&rdquo; Queen Vania, ruler of Qumran, sat opposite her amongst soft silk cushions the shade of mulled wine. As Rubella took her seat the Queen rested her hands in her lap the shiny folds of her skirts contorting the shadows as though she were clothed in the shimmering ocean itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Certainly, it will serve as a reminder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The Queen frowned, &ldquo;Of what.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Those who I trampled to make my way here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;A Crude observation,&rdquo; The Queen wrinkled her nose in disgust, &ldquo;Though I cannot deny, there is truth to your words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Your grace didn&rsquo;t appoint a Vizier to lie to her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The Queen winced, &ldquo;You never fail to impress me with your cynicism.&rdquo; She wafted the air with her hand to dismiss the subject.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Pray tell your grace, where is my counsel required?&rdquo; Asked Rubella, heeding the Queen&rsquo;s unspoken command. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Vania sunk her shoulders as she sighed, &ldquo;The palace,&rdquo; She glanced sideways and rested her temple against a fist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to meet Lord Yissachar&rsquo;s Ambassador, the Baroch or Lord Eshkol, to discuss marriage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella relaxed and crossed her arms and legs as she pondered, &ldquo;If I may your grace, marriage is a dull affair though allegiance with Nartsem will do much good for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;My maids tell me many stories of the man: gallant, generous&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella snorted, &ldquo;I see they fail to mention his fondness for drink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The Queen concurred through a wry smile, &ldquo;Though at their defence they speak only from the fanciful portraits and stories his servants bring me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Then &lsquo;twould be wise to take them with a pinch of salt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I fear then that there would be no salt left for the merchants of Nartsem.&rdquo; A rare jest from The Queen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gentle shudder the carriage came to a halt and the muffled creak of the iron lever broke the silence as the door swung down to create a set of steps that Rubella deftly rushed down in three fluid steps. She looked from side to side to see a retinue of guards armed in half-plate with crossbows at their sides and great halberds rested against their shoulders. Once she had confirmed that any potential conspirators would sooner find their heads across a steel edge she turned her attention to The Queen, &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Your grace, may I?&rdquo; Said Rubella as she offered a hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Indeed you may,&rdquo; replied The Queen as she took Rubella&rsquo;s hand and elegantly descended the steps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Rubella watched as The Queen&rsquo;s gaze rose from her feet to the palace before her. The palace was cushioned by four resplendent white marble walls and the keep itself rose three hundred feet above them its surface was a less pure speckled marble that portrayed beauty in its own abstract way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The keep was at the centre of a courtyard separated into four quads by paths that each met at the four entrances to the keep, large wooden doors with silver goblet shaped door knockers hammered into the face of each, the quads each had flower beds that were constantly in attendance by the gardeners &mdash;lest The Queen should set her gaze upon a single withered flower. Four suites: north, south, east, and west were each built along their respective walls looking out onto the quads so that even when sunlight was scarce nobles could dine indoors. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The courtyard was such a focal point of the palace that artists and poets from far and wide would visit with their lords to observe it. Towers at each corner of the palace served as observatories so that the minstrels might capture a fragment of the garden&rsquo;s glamour to bring home with them. Though intended as fortifications the towers were far from dull, wooden grids hung from the inside faces of each tower along with baskets which blossomed too with intricately arranged flowers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Marvellous isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Spoke The Queen amidst her breathless awe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; replied Rubella, &ldquo;And to think this is the place that you call home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The brief moment of tranquillity was soon disturbed by the hurried steps of a messenger boy whose tunic flapped about at his feet as he made haste to The Queen&rsquo;s retinue. Practised and ever cautious the Guards stepped in front of the boy and halted him as two came behind to flank, their halberds readied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The boy fell to a knee and bowed his head, &ldquo;I come with a message for Her grace and Lady Rubella.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;At ease.&rdquo; Commanded Rubella and immediately in one rigid motion the guards backed into their positions and stayed their weapons whilst the boy rose to his feet awaiting further command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Your message, young sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Lord Eshkol sends me,&rdquo; he splayed a palm before her with a wax seal fastened against a ribbon showing the emblem of The Naruco: an Elderberry tree, &ldquo;He eagerly awaits her grace&rsquo;s audience in the southern suite.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Before Rubella could dismiss the boy Vania spoke up, &ldquo;Your accent is not Nartsemnian, from where do you hail?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">For a second the boy was bewildered but with a sharp look from Rubella he remembered his courtesies, &ldquo;My father is from Qumran and my mother Nartsemnian your grace, I was sent by my father to serve his Lord Eshkol so that my familiar accent may ease her grace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Your father is a wise and compassionate man young sir, you may take your leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The messenger boy bowed once again and hurried back to his Lord. Steadily The Queen and her escort resumed their stroll to the southern suite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;You noticed it too your grace?&rdquo; Whispered Rubella.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Nay, pray tell.&rdquo; Replied the Queen matching her tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Still hushed Rubella explained, &ldquo;His wrists were bruised, dreadfully your grace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">A flash of disgust met The Queen&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;The mother I assume?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I daresay your grace, &lsquo;tis a traditional punishment in Nartsem for those who fail to wield a blade and in the child&rsquo;s case I should imagine it was not his first offence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What better could I expect from those who worship the &lsquo;god&rsquo; of the white flame.&rdquo; Uttered Vania a hint of ire lining her voice.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p></body></html>
