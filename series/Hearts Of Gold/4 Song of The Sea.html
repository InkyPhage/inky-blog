It was in these very fields that Enoch had fought the Ky&rsquo;Mura, as they rode by Thassi pointed out the statue. Twice as large as it should&rsquo;ve been it depicted Enoch in a much more flatteringly younger likeness channeling a column of flame into the mouth of a creature that looked to be a cross between an Otterandian Great-Cat and some winged serpent only heard of in ridiculous fables.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Thassi asked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enoch faced Thassi, who had his eyebrows raised, waiting for Enoch&rsquo;s verdict, &ldquo;The Ky&rsquo;Mura was bigger, it would take cattle in its claws and fly them away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorya whistled in awe whilst Thassi simply shook his head and clicked his tongue. They were each dressed in plain clothes: no sigil or armour save for the padded doublet that Jorya wore. There was no retinue either, for their men needed to prepare for their journey to The Crossing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enoch had to halt Noah suddenly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Out of nowhere a child holding a wooden horse between his legs and a burning torch in his left hand, &ldquo;Ha, burn foulest creature!&rdquo; The boy shouted in triumph raising the torch up to the statue in defiance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Before the child could drop the torch a woman, who Enoch could only assume was his guardian, ran for the boy scooping him up in one arm and taking the torch off him, &ldquo;Where did you get this, do you want to burn the </span><span class="c4 c6">blout&eacute;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;field down?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daddy gave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did he now,&rdquo; The woman simply huffed, &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;d best apologise to the gentleman and his sons.&rdquo; The woman said regarding Enoch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry mister.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">As the woman left Enoch turned to his companions who were trying their best to stifle their laughter. Jorya was clearly younger than Enoch but he reckoned the woman must have had a keen eye to see that Thassi was too, for he was the eldest of the Barochs and indeed also the youngest to become a Baroch. It was well known that Thassi had only seen twenty or so Dawns when he was elected as Baroch of Bar&rsquo;Tsi. Yissachar only </span><span class="c4 c6">looked</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;older, the stress of his office likely wearing the young Lord both physically and mentally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Enoch noted the path the woman took, it somewhat resembled a road and it stretched from the woodland to the north, around the statue, then continued to their destination. There was something about it that plagued him . . . it was oddly familiar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Enoc&rsquo;Krans, or in your tongue, The Saint&rsquo;s Road,&rdquo; Thassi explained having noticing Enoch&rsquo;s intrigue, &ldquo;Supposedly it is lain over the very tracks this one&rsquo;s hooves beat into the soil.&rdquo; Thassi leant over to ruffle Noah&rsquo;s mane but he backed out of Thassi&rsquo;s reach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a loyal horse.&rdquo; Thassi remarked with a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Where Bar&rsquo;Krans had been large and spectacular Bar&rsquo;Tsi was more quaint and Modest. Many of its houses were not made of brick but instead entirely crafted from wood, though they were unlike the dull houses of Roadway for they had a beauty in their tranquil sea-views. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thassi&rsquo;s residence, the hall of Bar&rsquo;Tsi, was like much else there&mdash;smaller than Daiya&rsquo;s villa. Being the one multistoried building in the entire city it seemingly loomed over everything else. The first floor office opened onto a rounded balcony where the Baroch could observe the various ships arriving: merchants, craftsmen, and most notably the Burand&eacute;r. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Burand&eacute;r ships were crafted mostly from the monsters they hunted, often with morbid trophies hung from the bow and stern&mdash;whether it was to deter monsters or advertise their profession to others it worked well. There was a saying amongst the Exorcists and the people of Burand&eacute;r, &ldquo;A sailor can do naught but get drunk on land, and fire can burn naught at sea.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the docks people would come to the Burand&eacute;r ships and ask which areas were safe, where they wanted to go, and what it would cost them; to which they&rsquo;d reply, &ldquo;A trophy or a ride?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">An old man</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;with three bodyguards alighted one such boat to meet a captain of Thassi&rsquo;s household guard. Though Enoch could not spot his sigil he couldn&#39;t help but pity that the man had made such a journey to little end, for his meeting with Thassi would be delayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to seek out a man named Ahran, who will serve as your guide and translator where needs be.&rdquo; Thassi handed a sealed piece of parchment to Enoch, Yissachar&rsquo;s missive likely written in Nartsemnian. The Burand&eacute;r spoke the same language as the Qumranians, for they too were once Qumranian long ago but as the romantics liked to say, &ldquo;Left for the thrill of adventure out at sea.&rdquo; When in reality they had been exiled long ago by Ezekiel. The Qumranians claimed they had the blood of the Huntsman in them, the one who&rsquo;d supposedly attempted to kill Ezekiel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thassi approached the men sitting idly on the longboat to enquire Ahran&rsquo;s whereabouts. Each of the Burand&eacute;r was dressed in an assortment of cheap pelts they could purchase at the docks and boiled leather, hand made from the parts of creatures they&rsquo;d slain. Their weapons like their clothes were too forged from the various horrors of the sea, it was often said that a Burand&eacute;r&rsquo;s axe or spear was his own invaluable trophy. Bone was shaped and sharpened into a deadly edge that whilst not quite durable enough to parry Otterandian or Qumranian steel could easily pierce the hides of their prey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thassi returned, &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s wandered off to find some craftsman, he&rsquo;ll be back soon but you&rsquo;re free to board, my servants will take good care of your horses until you return.&rdquo; Enoch needed no assuring that Noah would be fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I must part ways with you now if I wish to make it back before dusk, it was a pleasure to meet you &nbsp;Enoch Cyrus,&rdquo; Thassi bowed then turned to Jorya, &ldquo;One day you shall be a lord, mayhaps even one day the Naruco, use this experience wisely.&rdquo; Jorya nodded in response before the Baroch embraced the boy to wish him farewell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Enoch and Jorya boarded the longboat as Thassi departed without looking back once, one or two of the Burand&eacute;r looked up from tending to their weaponry or inspecting the rigging. One of the men stood up to clear a place for them on one of the benches and thrust his hands out in greeting. Enoch and Jorya shook his hands, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve both a firm shake but this young &lsquo;un &lsquo;ere ain&rsquo;t nearly as weedy as you,&rdquo; he paused for a moment, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an exorcist aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you guess?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The man grinned through his thick prickly beard, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true you might be weedy but your eyes,&rdquo; He nudged the trophies that hung from the bow of the ship so that they swung gently on their hooks, &ldquo;When you eyed these you were intrigued, not in the same way them bastards who like to put them up on a wall do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry &lsquo;bout the wait lads I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; A thinner boy with a cross between a mop and bowl of coppery brown hair ran up to the boat, a sack slung over his shoulders. The boy saw Enoch and Jorya then frowned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey Prickly, who&rsquo;re these folk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Prickly, the large man that had greeted them, stepped out of the boat causing the entire thing to rise. He grabbed the boy&rsquo;s shoulder then drove his knuckle into the boy&rsquo;s head making him squeal much to the rest of his crewmates&rsquo; amusement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;These&rsquo;re the folk that the Naruco wrote to you about, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve kept &lsquo;em waiting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;Ouch!&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Prickly grabbed the boy by the collar of his fur cloak and placed him on the boat. Understanding Prickly&rsquo;s unspoken command the boy fell into a bow and addressed them, &ldquo;I am very sorry Masters Enoch and Jorya, I am Ahran and I would like to, on behalf of Ualter and his people, welcome you aboard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And then to contrast Ahran&rsquo;s eloquent apology, Prickly shouted, &ldquo;Alright, lets cast off, if we go now we might just get a drink aboard the Wrath.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ualter&rsquo;s Wrath was monstrous in more than just size. The hull and keel were formed from the jaw and tailend of a great sea monster that Ualter himself had hunted. The creature had a mighty underbite with a row of enormous needle-like teeth that had been pushed forward so that they slid up the ship&rsquo;s bow. Its rib cage had been used to form the frame for the rest of the boat with an assortment of various types of wooden planks, cedars, birch, alder, rosewood, anything that the Burand&eacute;r could scavenge. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Wrath was practically a city for the Burand&eacute;r, swarmed by smaller boats and even some longships made from the carcasses of a much lesser sea monster and each one could serve as living quarters for a family. Many believed because of Ualter that the Burand&eacute;r were berserk and hunted monsters the size of mountains, whereas to them Ualter was very much the exception. Up in the crow&rsquo;s nest a Burand&eacute;r noticed them and swiftly descended to the main deck, a moment later and the man had flung a rope ladder overboard for them to climb. Enoch was amazed that the man had spotted them, the dark of night upon them with only the moonlight to see by. Prickly moored their boat by tying it to a large metal hook that was nailed into one of the Wrath&rsquo;s ribs then gestured to the rope ladder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Enoch bowed his head in gratitude then he and Jorya ascended to the ships deck, Ahran just behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alistare&rsquo;s brought on a fresh barrel of rum, get to the tap room now and might be there&rsquo;s still some left.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ahran replied to the watchman, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t mate, sorry, I&rsquo;ve to take these folk to see Ualter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to do no such thing.&rdquo; Ahran, Enoch and Jorya spun around to come face to face with a towering man. He wore naught but heavy leather breeches and a large fur cloak over his shoulders, his chest was bare and riddled with scars. The muscles in his arms and abdomen were looked as though they had been chiseled by a stone mason, his callus covered hands showed that his muscles had been put to good use too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he got closer, silent as the wind despite his size, his face came fully into view and they could see his blonde beard&mdash;white by the moonlight&mdash;along with his deep sea blue eyes that darted from each of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your watch Wyntar, drink with Ahran and our guests&mdash;I will not see them till the mornin&rsquo;, it would be ill of us to talk without offering you hospitality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks chief!&rdquo; Wyntar, without delay, made his way to the forecastle whilst Ualter made his way past them to climb to the crows nest. Subconsciously the three of them stepped back to let Ualter past, his very presence a command, inked into the back of Ualter&rsquo;s otherwise bald head was a sprawling tattoo of the great beast he&rsquo;d slain to make the very vessel they stood upon.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The taproom was located in the forecastle at the front of the ship, at the far end of the room barrels were arranged in a V shape where the boat&rsquo;s walls connected at the bow. One particular barrel had a tap hammered into it and a man stood beside it filling tankard after tankard and passing them to the men and women that queued up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A woman with golden blonde hair tied into a wide braid and slung over her shoulder was next up and began talking to the man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Prickly noticed Enoch watching them,&ldquo;Aye that&#39;s Ahran&rsquo;s brother Alistare and Kealey the chieftain&#39;s daughter, they&rsquo;re a pair alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alistare gave in and handed Kealey too full tankards of rum, the first she downed on her way back &nbsp;to her seat. A woman with mighty red hair tied into a barrette, likely crafted from the tooth of some savage beast of the sea, approached Prickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A pair, she&rsquo;s stronger than him, it&rsquo;s plain as day!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Prickly introduced the woman as his wife, Fervor, only shortly before he was pounced upon by their daughters who climbed his furs and tugged on his beard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ferv &rsquo;ll do just fine though.&rdquo; Ferv grinned, clearly happy to be rid of the children&rsquo;s excitement for even a moment of respite. When the Burand&eacute;r got married it was traditional for them to choose a name for their partner. One that described them to show how well they knew each other and lay claim to their name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alistare was not wholly alike his brother, strong, bearded and jovial where his brother was scrawny, beardless and shy in comparison though despite this Enoch agreed with Ferv. Though Kealey mightn&rsquo;t have looked as strong or as intimidating as her father there was a fierceness about her that Enoch thought Alistare would have a tough time contending with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before Ahran could stop her, Ferv reached for the sack over his shoulder and pulled from it a lute. She admired the lute in her hands, its body carved from Ash and rimmed with smoothed bone. The strings were steel and the notes separated out beautifully as she strummed them. The pickguard was delicately painted to look like the depths of the seas swarmed with all the most horrific monsters that the Burand&eacute;r hunted. Ferv whistled in awe and her daughters turned from their father for a moment to gape at the beauty of such a fine instrument.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So this is what all that Ivory was for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There was an Otterandian craftsmen who I&rsquo;d arranged to visit at Bar&rsquo;Tsi, I didn&rsquo;t realise his handiwork would take so long but I couldn&rsquo;t resist, look here at the drawings&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ferv shook her head and thrust the lute back into his hands, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much how it looks, not so much as I want to hear how it sounds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rest of the taproom had gone quiet, intent for a song.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know any songs fit for drinking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Kealey looked about her, then slammed her tankard down to announce, &ldquo;Fine, then we shan&rsquo;t drink awhile, we shall sit and listen.&rdquo; She watched Ahran with her head resting on her hands and elbows braced on the table, Ahran blushed when he met her gaze.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sat on the shore of a cold winter&rsquo;s eve, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A fire to warm my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The eerie whistle of wind in the trees, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A far off distant past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there I sat, and there I sang, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sang the song of the sea!</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All went still whilst the sun sank below,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A twilight soft did glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Underneath the sun&rsquo;s gaze and mine, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lady&rsquo;s hair did shine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so I looked, locked in a trance,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Entranced by the lady of the sea!</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soft as the sand underfoot,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A face so beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hands cool like the last sheets of snow,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A touch I&rsquo;ll never know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For away she goes, I know not whereto,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To another man&rsquo;s shore on the other end of the sea?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Everyone remained silent as the final chord of Ahran&rsquo;s song slowly faded out, their faces looked on in awe at the boy they&rsquo;d misjudged. Enoch hoped he could forgive himself for doubting Ahran. The wait he suffered earlier had been more than worth the performance he&rsquo;d witnessed, the deft pluck of each note, the sound of his soft voice resonating with the steel strings. Prickly&rsquo;s children began clapping wildly and soon the rest of the room erupted in applause&mdash;save for only two, Kealey and Alistare. Kealey was speechless and Alistare was furious, his face glowed red like molten iron.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alistare stood abruptly knocking his tankard over and spilling the rum over his companions whose outrage was drowned out by the applause. Ahran, who was fighting with Prickly and Ferv&rsquo;s daughters for possession of his lute, only noticed his brother approach at the last second. Alistare grabbed Ahran by his shoulder and led him out roughly with little resistance from his weedier brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A murmur passed over the Burand&eacute;r. Enoch took the initiative and tapped Jorya on the shoulder, the two of them followed Alistare out of the taproom. The door opened to the loud slam of Alistare swinging round and shoving his brother into the wall of the forecastle, Enoch supposed he was lucky that the ship was so well built that the wood refused to give even under such force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no fool, </span><span class="c4 c6">brother</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; Alistare snarled in disgust, &ldquo;I know what those words meant, and who they&rsquo;re for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They meant nothing Ali, they&rsquo;re not for anyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Alistare slammed his palm against the wall above Ahran&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c6">You </span><span class="c2">don&rsquo;t get to call me Ali, only Kealey does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;O-ok,&rdquo; Ahran squealed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So you stay away from her, she&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4 c6">mine</span><span class="c2">, got it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ahran stayed silent. Alistare&rsquo;s nostrils flared and he drew a fist back over his shoulder, before Jorya could even move a muscle Ualter appeared from the shadows. Ualter gripped Alistare&rsquo;s arm and twisted it behind his back, Alistare grimaced and groaned but Ualter&rsquo;s face remained stern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Ualter tilted his head forward and Enoch could only just make out his whispered words, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, my daughter isn&rsquo;t some trophy that you to hang in your quarters, if you&rsquo;re the man you say you are then you&rsquo;ve bigger fish to hunt.&rdquo; Ualter&rsquo;s commanding eyes darted to Jorya and Enoch, they helped Ahran to his feet and followed his murmured directions to lead him to his bunk below deck.</span></p><div><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
