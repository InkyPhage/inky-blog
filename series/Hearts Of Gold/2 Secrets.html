The Great Hall was the most magnificent room in the entire keep and rightly so for it was also the throne room. Three long spruce tables lay at the foot of the dias, each table had an engraved wooden bench beside it with velvet cushions where the lords and ladies would sit to feast. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not the living lords and ladies that stared at her. The pillars interspersed between the tables had the past queens of Qumran hewn into them, their blank eyes seemed to follow Rubella as she approached the dias. The living lords and ladies stood atop the dias in a huddle paying Rubella no heed though she too was a lady. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From where Rubella was she could only catch the occasional whisper or mutter of various events across the lands: betrothals, New Dawn feasts, markets, skirmishes with brigands, and arguments over land. At such a time land was often the topic of much courtly discussion, with fertile land growing scarce lords and ladies alike would go to great trouble making dealings both over and under the table. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The steward boy noticed Rubella stood at the foot of the dias and raised his voice above the others to announce her, &ldquo;Lady Rubella, The Queen&rsquo;s Vizier!&rdquo; The lords and ladies hushed and turned to see her, they looked on in awe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are all dismissed, all of you.&rdquo; A familiar voice commanded and the steward boy led the nobles betwixt the tables and out the Great Hall revealing the twin alcoves behind them upon the dais, the alcove on Rubella&rsquo;s right had a terrifyingly lifelike statue of the first and last King of Qumran, Ezekiel Stoneskin who held a great sword that looked as though it had twin rows of large obsidian teeth much like the smaller steel dips in Rubella&rsquo;s own swordbreaker. In the alcove opposite was Eshaal, Ezekiel&rsquo;s stunningly beautiful Queen who had saved her King from near death by plucking more than a hundred arrows from his back after a sorcerous huntsman had enchanted them to pierce his impenetrable hide. No one in Qumran worshipped gods but these venerated figures before her certainly came close for many. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sat in a strikingly tall backed carven throne was the woman that all men and women of Qumran deigned to worship, her grace Queen Vania, Mother of Stone and Steel. The statues in each alcove seemed to loom over her as she sat there passing her silent judgement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella fell into a bow and glanced upward to see the Queen rise from her throne and step forward, the deep crimson skirts of her royal raiments rolling down the steps of the dais ahead of her, as she stepped into the red light that shone through the stained glass window the necklace and rubies inlaid into the seams of her dress about her shoulders and down her sleeves caught the rays and flickered spectacularly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; Rubella obeyed looking up into the stern and loveless face of the Queen and the menacing copper crown that glowed like the hot tip of a poker. &ldquo;Is there anything that you would like to tell me before we begin?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes your grace.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh good, let&rsquo;s hear them then, your </span><span class="c3">excuses.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; a chilly resonance hung to that last word. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I did not wish to inform you until the matter was resolved, I felt that it would do you no good&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The Queen clicked her tongue, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it Rubella, the sorcerer slipped from your grasp and were it not for the brave soul who escaped the viper and gave his account at the gate just before he died neither you nor I would know what happened,&rdquo; She paused as she paced to the far end of the dais and spun on her heels with her hands, fingers interlaced, held against her abdomen and a wickedly venomous smile across her face, &ldquo;the </span><span class="c3">real</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;reason you did not inform me is because you </span><span class="c3">failed.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; The smile vanished from the Queen&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;you made me look a fool, a lowly sorcerer escaped the Queen&rsquo;s justice and walks freely where she daren&rsquo;t yet tread, do you know what nobles do with fools Rubella?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Rubella knew, but knew it would be better to stay silent. &ldquo;They try to swindle them, they&rsquo;re thieves with honeyed words instead of rusty shanks!&rdquo; She clenched her fists and bunched her skirt as if drawing in a blood red tide over the dais. The Queen walked back to her throne where she sat again with the tips of her fingers pressed against each other in front of her pursed lips. &ldquo;Merchants from across the Spine refuse to trade with one of their lords captive, many of the soldiers have begun to fear that the </span><span class="c3">Shoeden Kait</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;will come to free his father and all in his midst shall have their entrails hung from the walls.</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; The Queen thought for a moment, &ldquo;Now, what do you </span><span class="c3">wish </span><span class="c0">to tell me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lord Eshkol overheard the news, the account that Bekarys brought to me and&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen scoffed, &ldquo;That snivelling &lsquo;lord&rsquo; knew before me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella bowed her head to plead forgiveness before she continued, &ldquo;As such he was restrained and imprisoned, we have reason to believe that he commanded his son to whisk the sorcerer away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A long silence passed between them until the Queen spoke, &ldquo;I suppose I am partly to blame,&rdquo; she let loose a sigh, &ldquo;Ever since that lord took up his father&rsquo;s sword and slew Abarran.&rdquo; Rubella winced at her predecessor&#39;s name, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me nothing but success, and as such I have come to expect nothing less from you, just this once you are forgiven.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For only a moment Rubella let her shoulders droop in relief, &ldquo;Words cannot express how thankful I am your grace.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;With any luck the sorcerer shall burn in one of his dearly beloved temples once Yissachar gets his act together, go, you are dismissed.&rdquo; Rubella bowed once more before she turned to leave. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Outside the towering wooden double doors the steward boy waited for her, &ldquo;May I be of&mdash;m . . . my lady.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her brow was creased in fury and her cheeks flushed red in humiliation, &ldquo;You shall summon Lord Izaac at once! Her Majesty commands it.&rdquo; stunned the boy did not move, Rubella took a menacing step forward and the boy panicked then quickly regained his composure and went to seek the lord.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lord Izaac was taller than Rubella by only an inch, Rubella was better built however as Izaac&rsquo;s armor tended to rattle as he walked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it that her majesty wishes of me?&rdquo; He spoke in the gruff voice of a wizened old man, and wise he was for he had taught Rubella all he knew of warfare. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She has a missive for you, to deliver to Yissachar.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, it is an honor.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You shall set off on the morrow without delay.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As befits the word of her majesty.&rdquo; A wiry grin spread across the old lord&rsquo;s face and they went silent as they paced the cobbled path of the keep&rsquo;s gardens, passing by a lord and lady who they knew would be listening despite how occupied they were with each other. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once they were out of earshot Rubella spoke up &ldquo;Your son . . . Jedah?&rdquo; Izaac&rsquo;s head swung towards Rubella with a knowing glint in his eye showed that he knew where Rubella was steering the conversation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Jeremiah, Jedah owns an auction house, Judas squires for a friend of mine in the Queen&rsquo;s army, </span><span class="c3">Jeremiah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the . . . physician.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; Lord Izaac was lucky enough to have three sons and each of them were as unfalteringly loyal as their father. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I should like him to make something for me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Consider it done.&rdquo; The old lord bowed before leaving to attend to his duties.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was nearing midnight yet Rubella walked the streets without a torch. The guards posted at the dungeon, when they saw her step into the light of the braziers crossed their halberds across the doors </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At ease.&rdquo; She whispered showing them her Vizier&rsquo;s medallion </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re terr&rsquo;bly sorry t&rsquo; suspect you m&#39;lady, couldn&rsquo;t see yer without a torch.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say no more, you do your duty as I do mine.&rdquo; Rubella was not quick to enter the dungeons again, the Queen had been right, it had taken a good long bath to remove the stench of that place from her last visit. She lent in to the guards stationed and gave them a hushed command that had them nodding furiously then rushing from their posts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">She rapped twice on the door and listened carefully for the shuffle of the gaoler&rsquo;s boots against the floor and then the grunt as he lifted the bar so that the door could gently creak open just wide enough for the Queen&rsquo;s Vizier to step through. Without a word she pressed a finger to her lips and motioned for the gaoler to shut the door behind </span><span class="c4">her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which he performed diligently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The keys,&rdquo; Rubella beckoned with her hand, the gaoler fumbled with the link of keys around his belt and placed them in Rubella&rsquo;s palm, &ldquo;you do your Queen a great service.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rubella strode past each cell their inhabitants would turn their mucky faces toward her some even baring their teeth in disgust, noticing her medals of office in the dim light that the gaoler&rsquo;s torch at the top of the steps gave off. Rubella spotted a familiar face sneak a glance at her from the gloom of its cell as she made her descent, she chuckled softly then took a step back. &ldquo;Zacharus?&rdquo; She said just loud enough for him to hear, though he did not turn to face her his shoulders slumped when he heard his name. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How ironic, you&#39;re here whilst the exorcist walks free,&rdquo; Zacharus made no reply, &ldquo;What was it, murder? Thievery?&rdquo; Rubella pondered a moment, &ldquo; . . . Debt?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it was at all possible for such a man he would have sunk into the floor. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To think I paid you quite handsomely for breaking that flimsy thing you called a sword, a man with a blade is often well paid, a man with a drink often finds himself in the clink.&rdquo; Rubella knew it wasn&rsquo;t at all his fault, peace was not a moneymaker for sellswords, Rubella simply felt she needed to pass on the humiliation that she had been served by the Queen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In no time she was back to her witty and cunning self. She took upon her swaggering gait the rest of the way as she turned the bend to the right and took a torch from where it hung in the corner to light the rest of the way to the cells she sought. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the inmates who had grown accustomed to the darkness recoiled when what had previously been a distant star became a bright crackling flame. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was right at the far end of this branch of the dungeon that Rubella found Eshkol&rsquo;s cell, he sat with an arm over one knee staring at her as if he had anticipated this visit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you know of the contents of that grimoire.&rdquo; Rubella asked plainly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eshkol clenched a fist and then winced, he had been lucky enough that a scab had formed quickly enough over the cut that it hadn&rsquo;t been infected but it likely hurt nonetheless. &ldquo;Only that its contents are a knowledge so great that the nobles used magic lost to time to seal it, to protect us from a frightening truth.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;To </span><span class="c3">guard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the truth, to protect a lie.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eshkol cocked his head, &ldquo;It appears you know more than I.&rdquo; He brushed the red whiskers along his cheek with the back of his hand, squinting at Rubella through the glow of the torch held above her golden hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Paying his implications no mind Rubella continued to question him, &ldquo;And how did you come about what you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a secret my family has passed to the eldest son for a great time now, my father Eshtaol,&rdquo; Eshkol grit his teeth, remembering his father&rsquo;s untimely death no doubt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Abarran was like a father to me you know, Eshtaol did not fall at my hand, yet Abarran,&rdquo; Rubella pointed in accusation at Eshkol, &ldquo;did fall at yours, at the blade of Esh.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The family of Esh was thought to be as old as the land itself, Rubella thought in that regard it may have been obvious that they had a hand in the grimoire, they supposedly traced their lineage back to Eshaal herself who much of their family got their namesake from. The family of Esh rarely vied for power, content with the council position that they had held onto for many Dawns in Nartsem. With their shared heritage the family had maintained good connections with the royal family in Qumran, likely why Yissachar had appointed Eshkol his emissary, Bar&rsquo;Cythen was named in honor of the Mother of Stone and Copper in exchange for the gift of the family&rsquo;s iron blade, the blade of Esh. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your son, has Jorya been told any of this?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eshkol shook his head, &ldquo;I know you must think that I sent for him, to save our saint, I did not.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And why wouldn&rsquo;t I think you are lying?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What reason has a dead man to lie?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A parent would do anything for their child.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then I would swear it on the flame, that which gave me life&mdash;the life of my son.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubella shook her head. Eshkol shuddered hearing the click of the key turning in the lock then the shrill creak as the cell door opened and shut behind Rubella. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You,&rdquo; she went to &nbsp;her side and slid Swordbreaker from its scabbard, the teeth of the blade seemed to cackle as they scraped against the metallic rim of the scabbard, &ldquo;shall swear it by the blade.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A deathly whistle sounded and Eshkol screamed for help. None came. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Rubella left the cell and made the ascent back past the inmates they stared at her silently listening to the thud as whatever was in the sack she hauled over her back swung against the steps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Upon leaving the dungeon Rubella spat on the ground at her feet, &ldquo;The bloody sadist that thought it would be smart to build sewers next to a dungeon . . . or perhaps the other way round.&rdquo;</span></p><div><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
