As they set off they soon discovered it was quite the challenge to lead Noah along the narrow winding rocky path. Though the horse was obedient he was quite large causing him to teeter if he got too close to the edge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorya made conversation to break the silence, &ldquo;I hope to reach Lev&rsquo;Tue &mdash;Dewa as it&rsquo;s now called&mdash; before dusk that we might sup and sleep there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Queen had it renamed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aye, like most places after the battle, people would find it easier they claimed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At least they kept its meaning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They say for weeks it was blood that fell from those trees, not dew,&rdquo; Jorya shook his head, &ldquo;The people of the shadowed lands, of the few Nartsemnians that remain rarely keep good company, even with New Dawn ahead of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Since Vania took them her people have moved in, it&rsquo;s tense to say the least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Before the Battle of Lo&rsquo;Woam and the Great Drive I remember Nartsem and Qumran being on good terms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They were but many believe Manassess died too soon, when my Uncle Yissachar ascended he was loved yes but yet young, many see his marriage to Vania as a betrayal but Yissachar knows that without it we may never have peace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I see, so with Manassess gone there is no love for the Qumranians, I remember the day he rode into Naruco, saying he would give shelter to anyone no matter where they were from.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My father fought aside Yissachar in the Great Drive, they took our merchants hostage, any Nartsemnian who so much as uttered Manassess&rsquo; name or praised the life-giver . . .&rdquo; Jorya clenched a fist, &ldquo;When they made the push they found a great many corpses on the other side of The Spine . . . soldiers hadn&rsquo;t even given them the mercy of a burial, they&rsquo;d dumped them away from the road for the anakim to feast on so that they wouldn&rsquo;t disturb the camp.&rdquo; The air was still as both fell silent to make an unspoken prayer for those lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping to cheer the boy up Enoch broke the silence, &ldquo;What plans have you for the New Dawn then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grin broke Jorya&rsquo;s sullen expression, &ldquo;My father plans for a great feast, he jokes it&rsquo;ll empty half the Naruco&rsquo;s coffers, though when he brought the bill before Yissachar, well, if all of Nartsem did not hear him bellow.&rdquo; New Dawn was celebrated by both Nartsem and Qumran, it marked a new beginning, from winter spring rose forth. Many customs were associated with New Dawn; hearty drinking to good health and a great harvest, boys and girls becoming men and women, bracelets and crowns crafted from the new blossoms for loved ones, children singing in the streets casting petals at all those who passed. The Merry were not lost in Nartsem. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">They slowed and gazed on the land that the parting mountains had unveiled, the radiant midday sun lit up the yellow-green fields of grass and grazing animals, the canopies of tall trees swayed in the breeze, earthy-green leaves iridescent in the bare sun&rsquo;s wake, lochs shimmered as the brilliant light scattered over the ripples of their waters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">If Enoch had never seen Nartsem before he would have wondered how it could be so vibrant and lively despite the tailend of winter still upon them, yet another stark difference from their neighbours. Whilst Qumran was held high in the wake of mountains, Nartsem fell much lower with but a few rolling hills and mounds dotted across the land so that the vast seas could be clearly seen beyond it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch looked to his side where Jorya stood, eyes squinted looking to the north of the land. Even from such a distance away the great walls of Naruco could be made out, saturated limestone with vines sprawled over the walls like the chaotic drawings of a young child. Enoch&rsquo;s gaze fell as he laid eyes upon the foot of the mountains where with a stretch of woodland before them were a small network of villages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jorya said as he pointed to the village closest to the mountains. Lev&rsquo;Tue was the largest of the villages and smoke billowed from the chimneys of ramshackle houses made from a crude combination of wood and mud bricks. The Shadowed Lands looked as though they&rsquo;d inherited the gloom that their invaders dwelt in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Used to forge silver blades and other trinkets from what they could find in the mines, now their fires are being used to bake bricks for granaries and forge ploughs to till the land.&rdquo; Jorya let out a sigh as he finished, &ldquo;All the good &nbsp;iron they find in the mines they send straight over the crossing, don&rsquo;t trust our smiths.&rdquo; Jorya began to walk on once again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">For a while they walked with only the gale that weaved through the rocks to accompany them, the quiet patter of loose soil that fell down the cliff side to their right and the occasional murder of crows would burst out of nowhere, the faint scritch scratch of talons their only tell. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Only it wasn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c3 c7">their</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;tell. </span><span class="c3">Enoch </span><span class="c1">cursed that he did not notice it, did not see the thin bony hand until it had firmly locked its long claws around Jorya&rsquo;s ankle, or even when it had crept up the cliff face below them when they stopped to admire the view. With a lunge the thing pulled itself upward throwing Jorya back with the force of its leap. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">An Aynjal, torn shreds of its blemished hide hung like loose fabric from bony wings and went taut as it spread them outward revealing its gaunt body, armoured in a layer of leathery skin that sucked against its lungs when it breathed. The Aynjal&rsquo;s head folded against its body then sprung out and bobbed like a cockerel&#39;s as it approached the boy. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Jorya desperately shook out his foot to free himself, only once the Aynjal had recoiled it let out a screech from its hooked beak, its eyes pulsating with a kaleidoscopic glow from beneath the film that was stretched over its face. Jorya drew Shoeden Kait thrusting the point of the blade towards the Aynjal&rsquo;s chest, but it pulled its wings across to block the blow and the blade slid along it. Jorya tumbled forward. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch summoned flame to his palm and made his approach and in the moment forgot. Aynjals were not strong because of their deceptively tough wings or vice claws, they were the only anak that fought in numbers. Two more sprung up in front of Jorya and wrapped the talons of their feet around his shoulders whilst the first came from behind. It swung its neck around and pierced Jorya&rsquo;s neck with its hooked beak, raking the flesh to make way for a gushing stream of blood. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch felt that cold weight before, the despair he had felt when Eilam fell before him and he could do nothing. Without another moment&#39;s hesitation, he reached out and poured his magic &mdash;his fire&mdash; into Jorya. The Aynjals flew back before the plumes of fire could touch them and Jorya dropped to his knees, arms thrown back as he began convulsing, tongues of white flame leaping into his throat. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">The white flame sputtered out and Jorya&rsquo;s head fell forward yet his shoulders and throat were mended, the skin had completely regenerated and the colour returned to his face. Jorya grabbed his blade and rose slowly, two Aynjals beat their wings in unison as they hovered curiously in front of him whilst the other fell to all fours and folded in its wings to pounce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Shouted Enoch as the Aynjal leapt once again hurtling toward Jorya&rsquo;s back with its claws ready to rend flesh once again. Jorya suddenly turned his head to show his eyes, dilated pupils with a lilac tipped white flame dancing in them, the ebb of the calm yet unfettered storm that brewed within. Jorya raised his blade and the sigils upon it glowed, the Aynjal panicked and wrapped itself in the embrace of its wings mid flight. Successive strikes that Enoch&rsquo;s eye barely caught flashed, Jorya&rsquo;s blade severing the wings from the Aynjal&rsquo;s shoulders. The two that hovered screeched announcing their own fury and dived for Jorya.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not this time.&rdquo; Enoch muttered as he charged into the Aynjals, kicking his feet to lift him off the ground briefly and lend momentum to his blazing palms as they met the Aynjal&rsquo;s grotesque faces. The Aynjal whose wings had been clipped by Jorya fell to its knees clutching the stumps that were left. Jorya splayed his hand and aimed the point of his blade through finger and thumb before plunging it into the Aynjal&rsquo;s chest, its blood began to boil and a hiss of vapours rose from the film that covered its face, then its body began to blacken till it became nothing more than a charred corpse. Enoch turned back to look at the Aynjals in his own hands that had gone limp, though only their heads had been carbonised. Enoch then watched again as Jorya blinked and his pupils shot out again and the fire in his eyes vanished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;W-what were those?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aynjals,&rdquo; Enoch answered, &ldquo;they make their homes in the mountains and blend in amongst the rocks so that they can catch their prey by surprise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Real anakim.&rdquo; whispered Jorya looking at the dried golden blood that covered his blade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I hesitated I&mdash;&rdquo; Before Enoch could finish Jorya placed his blade at Enoch&rsquo;s feet and dropped into a bow, one knee on the ground with a hand braced on the other and a palm pressed to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only in bard&rsquo;s songs and tales have I ever heard of these creatures and that power, until now, Master Enoch I ask that you make me your warden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jorya . . . I am no Lord, your service would be wasted on me, I will never wage war nor sit a council.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And yet I would settle for no Lord, no end of Lords would accept my pledge but none are as noble as you,&rdquo; Jorya gazed upward in awe at Enoch, &ldquo;If I might one day govern these lands like my father then I wish to see them all for what they truly are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; Enoch picked up the blade that still hummed softly with the heat of his flames, he placed the face of the blade on Jorya&rsquo;s shoulder and Jorya inclined his head again.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jorya, I take you as my warden, that your blade would stay innocent flesh and protect it from that which lurks in the shadows, arise Jorya!&rdquo; Enoch took the boy&rsquo;s hand and lifted him up turning his palm to face the sky placing Shoeden Kait firmly in his grasp. Jorya sheathed the blade once he was stood. Not a word passed between them as they continued down the rocky path the soft clop of Noah&rsquo;s hooves filling the silence they left behind them.</span></p><p class="c0 c5 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">When they reached Dewa the thick scent of baking bricks greeted them, many a face was upturned in midst of the odour. Villagers about with a heavy sunken gait as if they were dragging their feet through a swamp yet the soil beneath them was rough and dry. Jorya produced from Noah&rsquo;s saddlebags two cloaks with plain unornamented silver pins fastening them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Though to at least one of the realms you are likely assumed dead I&rsquo;d rather take no chances.&rdquo; They made their way to an Inn called The Leaking Tap and Jorya tossed the stable hand a copper nodding toward Noah and the boy immediately got to work making sure the faithful stallion was brushed and fed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">When they entered the Inn they discovered that the taproom was almost deathly silent, save for one group of patrons &mdash;mercenaries sparsely clad in tarnished steel plate with boiled leather, breastplates, and greaves. One among them walked over to the bar, two other patrons who had to move their heads either side as her plated arm reached past them, their stares looked up from the bottom of their tankards only briefly as they gave the Innkeep an irritated look.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For my boys, let &lsquo;em drink till they roll over!&rdquo; She dropped a heavy purse into the Innkeeper&#39;s hands that rattled with the wealth of coppers it held.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hear tha&rsquo; lads, Missy&rsquo;s pu&rsquo; &lsquo;er purse behind th&rsquo; bar!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lesssss drink up to a job well done.&rdquo; Empty tankards were flung out by each man as they leaned back off their stool, cheeks already ablaze with alcohol. They haphazardly dangled the tankards in front of the barmaids as they came around with jugs of ale to refill them, each one wore a smile purely out of courtesy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You boys best make sure you ain&rsquo;t too soused to ride come morn!&rdquo; Yelled Missy as she backed out of the Inn shouldering Enoch and Jorya as she did, &ldquo;Ah blast, sorry lads.&rdquo; She patted Enoch on the back as her head swung back and forth in a trance of drunken stupor then left with a salute to her companions who roared and toasted to her good health in response, froth from their full tankards showering those who sat at nearby tables. Enoch and Jorya exchanged looks and approached the bar where a small grin was carved into the Innkeeper&rsquo;s pudgy clay-like face, in a thick Nartsemnian accent he asked them, &ldquo;Fair men! How might I help ye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorya answered, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like two rooms and breakfast at daybreak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Very well sir, Prish! Book these fair men in will ye.&rdquo; The Innkeep listened until he heard a muffled response, &ldquo;Go to my daughter Prish once you&rsquo;re ready and she&rsquo;ll show you your rooms, elsewise sit, eat, and drink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch and Jorya sat at the bar, the two men who had glared at the Innkeep turned to them and one asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from Qumran yet you don&rsquo;t look as though you&rsquo;re from these parts either, what brings men like yourselves to The Shadowed Lands?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorya explained, &ldquo;We came from Bar&rsquo;Krans to see The Spine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ha, can&rsquo;t imagine that was much fun, after the devils you met up there this place probably seems like a palace.&rdquo; The other remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are no devils this side of The Spine,&rdquo; the first pointed out, &ldquo;Unless you count that ruckus.&rdquo; He gestured to the table of mercenaries behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inkeep caught on and snarled at them, &ldquo;Enough. They&rsquo;re customers the same as ye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You got a soft spot now that your daughter is married to one of those stonemen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did he suggest that name? The Leaking Tap? what happened to pride and honor,&rdquo; the patron turned to Jorya and Enoch and explained, &ldquo;Afore the stonemen won the battle of Lo&rsquo;Woam this place was called Manassess&rsquo; Joy, Yuvielle Manassess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My boy died to those swiving stonemen, not by blade but plague, and here you are pocketing their coin whilst they drink themselves stupid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this any more than ye, but I have a family to feed, and for god&#39;s sake the Queen&rsquo;s men herself told me to change the name elsewise they&rsquo;d take it from me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">One of the men drained his tankard and slammed it onto the bar top, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather starve.&rdquo; He spat into the tankard and left, his companion followed suit.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">The Innkeep loosed a heavy sigh and wiped his brow as the men left, &ldquo;Forgive me sirs, I fear my temper got the best of me, &nbsp;a round on the house for your troubles!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Master?&rdquo; Jorya said as he turned to Enoch, a giddy grin across his hooded face.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch rolled his eyes and nodded at Jorya then turned to the Innkeep, &ldquo;Thank you good sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tis no bother m&rsquo;lord.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no L&mdash;&rdquo; before Enoch could finish Jorya nudged him, &nbsp;a reminder of the caution they exercised.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cheers,&rdquo; Enoch said raising his freshly poured tankard to the Innkeep in gratitude.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch took a sip of his ale and turned to Jorya who had his head tipped back, froth bubbling in the thin moustache that had begun to grow, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve called me master ever since we first met, had you planned to pledge yourself then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nay, when I was younger I was placed under the tutelage of an exorcist to be taught history, religion, the other lord&rsquo;s sons and I called him Master Sarig.&rdquo; Jorya tilted his tankard and peered inside as though he may have missed some, &ldquo;I guess it just seemed right.&rdquo; Jorya paused and shrugged then placed four coppers on the bar and raising his hand for another tankard. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">A barmaid offered to refill Enoch&rsquo;s tankard but he shook his head and pointed to Jorya and then swiftly leant backward as Jorya&rsquo;s hand shot out, his cheeks flushed whilst he swayed drunkenly in his stool, &ldquo;On second thought my companion seems to have had enough.&rdquo; The Barmaid blinked and cast a look that told Enoch she couldn&rsquo;t have cared much less before she walked back towards the table where the Qumranian men were sat. When Enoch turned back to Jorya his shoulders were hunched and his mouth hung open in shock as he tried to protest but his words slurred becoming an unintelligible mess. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">Enoch sighed and took one of Jorya&rsquo;s arms, flinging it over his shoulders as he helped the drunken boy walk. In the doorway of the hall leading to the rooms stood a young beady eyed woman (likely only two or three Dawns Jorya&rsquo;s elder) her hair was a braided dirty blonde and freckles spotted her cheeks as she smiled dutifully.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prish? Could you show us to our rooms please.&rdquo; It had been a while since Enoch had used his Nartsemnian but Prish understood nonetheless and nodded, frantically beckoning them with her hand as she guided them to their rooms. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Once Enoch had made sure Jorya had a soft mattress underneath him he followed Prish to his own room, she glanced down both ends of the hallway before pushing the door open to reveal a hooded figure sat at the foot of the bed, &ldquo;Thanks dear, please leave me with the gentleman if you would.&rdquo; Even without his usual garments, jewellery and gilded fabrics, Enoch could recognise the man by his pearly white teeth alone, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve much to discuss Enoch.&rdquo; said Meir a cautious grin on his face.</span></p><div><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6"></span></p></div></body></html>
