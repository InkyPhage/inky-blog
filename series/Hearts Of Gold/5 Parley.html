Abarran had ridden along this very road twice: once to meet Manassess and deliver the Queen&rsquo;s declaration of war, then again to meet Gibbar and Eshtaol for what the Nartsemnian Chroniclers now called the Grand Drive. Stories were told in Qumran of how Abarran had fought valiantly, single handedly felling the two lords in combat. His halberd striking them with a dark flash of the brutally efficient axehead densely packed with steel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The account of Abarran&rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated by Nartsem. The two sons were vengeful. Yissachar and Eshkol charged Abarran who outmatched them both, throwing them to the ground. Desperately reaching for his blade Yissachar fastened his grip around a flail by chance and swung wildly landing a lucky blow on Abarran&rsquo;s face, permanently blinding him. Eshkol took the opportunity to lift the back of Abarran&rsquo;s chain shirt and thrust the blade of Esh up through his heart thus claiming the life of the only man she&rsquo;d ever admired. Abarran had been her mentor who had made her everything she was, pathed the path for everything she could be.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A racket filled her ears, the wheels of the wagon spinning briefly out of control as they went over an uneven part of the road. Rubella had demanded that the wagon was driven alongside her. Eshkol had already attempted to escape the previous day when they had stopped at a lonely farmstead just over the Stonecut Ravine to water and groom their horses, the farmer had diligently pursued the escaped lord who could do little more than stumble through the fields. Rubella had compensated the farmer for his hard work as though she were throwing a morsel to a hunting hound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oi!&rdquo; Bekarys, who rode at Rubella&rsquo;s right, shouted back to the wagon driver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella turned to look as the wagon halted and Bekarys rode up behind to lift the fallen sack back into the wagon. Some of the soldiers that surrounded the wagon caught a glimpse of its contents and Rubella noticed them tighten their grip on their horse&rsquo;s reins desperately trying to avoid her gaze. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bekarys remounted and they began moving again, &ldquo;Carefully.&rdquo; he sneered as he passed the wagon&rsquo;s driver who was nodding fearfully in response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella listened whilst a number of her retinue who thought they were out of earshot started talking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d o&rsquo; thought without th&rsquo; Mother things&rsquo;d be a lot more laid back.&rdquo; Moaned a younger cavalier, whose promotion Rubella had seen to herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His aged captain replied, &ldquo;Back in th&rsquo; Keep is prolly better &lsquo;an out &lsquo;ere, plenty o&rsquo; wine for the New Dawn, Queen&rsquo;ll be quieter bedridden.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye! I&rsquo;d forgotten it was New Dawn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The standard bearer heard them and was taken aback, &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Mother&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo; He asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She fell ill jus&rsquo; before we set out, tha&rsquo;s why Rubella is gonna be speaking in &lsquo;er stead.&rdquo; The captain explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be fine right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye, Rubella does good at these kinda things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nah, I mean th&rsquo; Mother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeremiah, y&rsquo;know Lord Izaac&rsquo;s son, gave &lsquo;er some o&rsquo; &lsquo;is concoctions.&rdquo; The cavalier reassured the young standard bearer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye but Jeremiah left with &lsquo;is father, now she&rsquo;s only got that Nartsemnian boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Knowin&rsquo; his kind first chance he gets he&rsquo;s like to stab &lsquo;er in th&rsquo; back.&rdquo; The cavalier practically spat the words out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The captain clicked his tongue, &ldquo;Not likely, steel&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s weapon, more like to poison &lsquo;er.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bekarys&rsquo; ears pricked up and in a huff he rode back down the column, &ldquo;You fools!&rdquo; He snarled, &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know yous personally I&rsquo;d think yous were plannin&rsquo; treason!&rdquo; Baekarys simply growled before he rode back to the front of the column, his mare kicking up the dirt as if to mirror her rider&rsquo;s fury. Rubella heard not a word from her men after that.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They reached The Crossing a short time after daybreak, the sun still hung low in the sky at their backs. Clouds thinned in places to give the appearance of thin blood red veins in the sky as the early morning sun stained them with its vibrant light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Crossing was a grand thing, a thing for which there were few stories to explain it. Located where the mountain range of The Spine broke briefly. The Crossing brought The Grand Road to a steep upward incline before levelling off to form a woodland plain. The woods &nbsp;had been tamed against the mountains either side so that merchants would have easy passage over the border between Qumran and Nartsem. The Crossing was home to a small community of wildlife, though most impressively, no Anakim&mdash;a world between the two, free of any horrors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Today there would be no merchants making the crossing, for they would be in Nartsem profiting off the revelry the neighboring realm seemed to frequently indulge in. This was not to say that Qumran did not celebrate New Dawn, it was the only day Rubella knew that </span><span class="c2 c3">every</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;realm celebrated. Qumran had never been overly indulgent. With less cultivable land than its neighbors it had always sought to simply get by. It was in the mountains the Qumranians indulged, for they were rich with gemstones that lords and ladies craved to decorate themselves with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having ascended The Crossing Rubella looked over the horizon and spotted dots far off, a column of riders making their way up The Grand Road from Bar&rsquo;Krans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella turned to Bekarys, &ldquo;They have yet to arrive, we shall pitch tents that our men might rest briefly and so that when The Naruco does arrive he shall be greeted with apt hospitality.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bekarys nodded then rode off to bark her orders at the captains who in turn informed their own men to pitch the tents. It was not long before the air was filled with the loud ringing of steel hammers striking tent pegs into the earth. Soon The Crossing was host to what surely appeared to be the most dull carnival anyone had ever laid eyes upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the centre of their camp was a makeshift wooden table with two tall-backed chairs either side. Over the table, supported by a thin wooden frame, was a thick piece of cloth that shielded the table from sun and rain. Rubella sat in the chair with Qumran behind it and Nartsem ahead of it, intently watching the horizon for when Yissachar and his own retinue would appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bekarys brought her a pitcher of ale and an earthenware cup. Rubella poured the ale so that it filled the cup just below the brim, &ldquo;Pass me your wineskin.&rdquo; Bekarys shot her a puzzled look but obeyed nonetheless. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella emptied the contents of the wineskin into the earth beside her before fastening it to her hip, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best be sober for this.&rdquo; She pushed the cup in his direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beyarkys was stunned, &ldquo;Y-yes m&rsquo;Lady,&rdquo; He tipped the cup to take a gulp of ale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get some rest, but first order your most spritely men on watch, I should like them to inform me then stir the rest when Yissachar nears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As you command it m&rsquo;Lady.&rdquo; Bekarys marched off to do her bidding before he took the opportunity to rest up with the rest of the soldiers.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Four hundred yards!&rdquo; Rubella stirred at the yell of the men on watch, though she had hoped to stay awake she had let herself drift off where she sat. Rubella herself then yelled to both wake the rest of her men and herself. Resting the men had been a good decision; they were bright, lively, and most importantly ready to meet the Nartsemnian party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar slowed his stallion to a trot as he threaded his way between the tents, the soldiers he passed fell into a bow. Whether or not this pleased him Rubella could not tell, he wore a grim expression that somehow appeared darker than the black of his padded doublet and long cloak. It was only because the red sunlight caught on the pale silvery sigils embossed onto his torso that she even knew the doublet was patterned and not some bland sparring garment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella let Yissachar and Thassi&rsquo;s men fill in behind him before she rose and all, save for Yissachar himself who now stood before her, bowed&mdash;not for her, but for the Queen she stood for. Rubella offered Yissachar a hand and he shook it firmly then took the seat opposite her, the men around them stood alert to attention once She and Yissachar had taken their seats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella gestured to the standard bearer who rushed over with two cups but Yissachar raised his own hand to halt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I shall not have our minds sullied whilst we negotiate.&rdquo; Though he did his best to decline politely there was a rough edge of resentment to his voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Rubella waved her hand and the obedient standard bearer was dismissed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And before we speak of negotiations I should like to know, where is my lady-to-be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas she is ill so I, her vizier, shall speak in her stead.&rdquo; She watched as Yissachar noted her medallion, confirming her position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar winced, &ldquo;I was not aware, give her my condolences upon your return.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Firstly I would like to see Lord Eshkol with my own eyes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella motioned to two of her men and they brought Eshkol from the wagon, he wore a white shirt that had been dirtied by the dungeons, his wrists were bound and his mouth gagged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is the meaning of </span><span class="c2 c3">this,</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; Yissachar was red with rage as he pointed to the bloody bandage over Eshkol&rsquo;s palm and gag in his mouth, &ldquo;Eshkol is a </span><span class="c2 c3">lord,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;not some common criminal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I confess that I retaliated when Lord Eshkol attacked me, however, I met his assault with appropriate force.&rdquo; Rubella lazily waved her hand as if to swat the very words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar raised his brow, &ldquo;And the gag?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella explained, &ldquo;He is not the Lord Eshkol you once knew, he attempted to bite his tongue and bleed himself to death on his way here, were it not for captain Bekarys he may have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar clenched a fist and calmed, even if only ever so slightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So we&#39;ve your lord, what have you to offer us?&rdquo; Rubella&rsquo;s chair groaned when she leant backwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar snapped his fingers and his own soldiers brought forward a man bound at his wrists, dressed in tattered vestments of the life-givers faith. &ldquo;You want justice, well here&#39;s the man who escaped your clutches.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment Rubella was surprised, she had not thought they would have the audacity to forsake their appointed saint, but then the man lifted his head. Despite the gag Rubella noticed his teeth immediately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">&ldquo;I&#39;ll play along&mdash;for now.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rubella mused though she kept a straight face. She turned to Bekarys who had noticed too but read the silent command on Rubella&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Putting on a puzzled face, Rubella asked, &ldquo;I fail to understand how you could possibly even </span><span class="c2 c3">consider</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;offering up Enoch Cyrus to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is true that I owe much to him, however, I respect your justice&mdash;Vania&#39;s justice&mdash;so much more.&rdquo; Answered Yissachar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A smug grin spread across Rubella&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Then if you respect her justice, why do you demand your Lord Eshkol be treated any less than the criminal he is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was ire in Yissachar&rsquo;s voice once again, &ldquo;He is </span><span class="c2 c3">my</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;lord, I shall judge him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He threatened me, the one who sits in </span><span class="c2 c3">your</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;queen&#39;s stead.&rdquo; Countered Rubella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yet you are not she.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am second </span><span class="c2 c3">only</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to she, I </span><span class="c2 c3">am </span><span class="c1">her justice.&rdquo; There was a moment of unnerving silence. Yissachar sat back in his seat, the corners of his mouth twitching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But if I am to take you at your word, then why should I trade you a lord for a criminal?&rdquo; Rubella refused him eye contact. She began to play with her hair, twirling stray strands of it into curls around her finger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar spluttered, &ldquo;that is not what I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thassi leant into Yissachar&#39;s ear and whispered something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine then, if its coin you want then name your price, for there is none I wouldn&#39;t pay for a friend.&rdquo; Yissachar&#39;s men seemed to stand taller at those words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Jorya.&rdquo; Eshkol&rsquo;s head rose and he tried to protest but his voice was muffled by the gag in his mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll </span><span class="c2 c3">what?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella had grown bored of her charade, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call that a steal, a lordling for a lord where earlier you were willing to break even.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yissachar looked to the fake Enoch and then back to Rubella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella chuckled, this was priceless, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t really think I wouldn&rsquo;t recognise Lord Meir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo; Yissachar slammed his fist into the table, &ldquo;one lord for another, why not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One for one?&rdquo; This time it was Yissachar&rsquo;s turn to look puzzled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella clicked her fingers and Beyarys approached the wagon. Eshkol began to writhe desperately trying to yell something through his gag, a soldier put a boot to his back to shut him up. Yissachar looked ready to burst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bekarys handed Rubella a sack that she unfastened and dropped on the table before Yissachar. His face went from red to ghostly white in seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How many lords are five heads worth.&rdquo; Eshkol&rsquo;s attendants, all five of them had paid that night in the dungeons&mdash;their faces locked in an eternal scream. There were markings around the stumps, a signature of Rubella&rsquo;s blade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of Thassi&rsquo;s men stumbled forward to get a better look then drew his sword above his head, charging toward Rubella whilst yelling some Nartsemnian curse. Rubella stood and stepped past the charging soldier, drew her sword in a flash and sliced up his back. The man fell silent. Falling dead, face first into the dirt. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of a sudden shouts roared around her from friend and foe alike. Rubella ducked under a strike and grabbed the fallen soldier&rsquo;s half-helm. When she rose again she saw a group of soldiers closing around her in a circle, the tighter they drew that circle the surer her death would be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella leapt at the furthest soldier, her blade briefly eclipsing the rising sun, the soldier raised his blade just-in-time to block her strike but the weaker silvered blade was not strong enough and was cut clean in two by her sword-breaker. Rubella crouched and slid her blade along the soldier&rsquo;s exposed hip, teeth of steel grating against bone and flesh. The soldier clutched his bleeding side and wailed in agony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two more soldiers ran at Rubella breaking their hastily made formation, a fatal mistake, it seemed that every one of them wanted to be known as the man who slew Qumran&rsquo;s Vizier. She blocked both strikes by placing her hand behind her blade and catching the swords in the teeth of her own. Rubella dared to look around her for a second, it was chaos, both sides had erupted into a frenzy of blood and metal. The soldier on her right drew his blade back and made to drive the point into her gut but she pushed him back with a kick that threw him off balance then abruptly twisted her blade so the left soldier&rsquo;s sword spun out of his hands and he was left unarmed. As she glanced to her right she noticed that some of Eshkol&rsquo;s men had unbound him and were attempting to escort him to Thassi who was winding his way through the chaos on horseback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">&ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Rubella thought. She made quick work of the two soldiers before her, driving the point of her sword-breaker through the eye slit on the right soldier&rsquo;s helm then grabbing his sword and hurling it into the left soldier&rsquo;s thigh. Whilst the left soldier was immobilized Rubella took the opportunity to wrench her own sword from the other soldier&rsquo;s face. Before she could deliver a finishing blow to the other, a group of soldiers charged past him and toward her. Bekarys&rsquo; and his men intercepted their path and pushed them back with their shields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You chase th&rsquo; sod down!&rdquo; Beyarkys shouted back at her. Rubella ran after Eshkol, navigating the battle with relative ease, for her own men were well rested and were pushing back against the Nartsemnians who had not had much time to rest since reaching The Crossing. Eshkol&rsquo;s escort fought hard and admirably bringing the Lord to safety atop Thassi&rsquo;s horse, the watchmen weren&rsquo;t well rested and could do nothing as the stallion bolted past them. Rubella slowed to a halt and cursed, she watched them gallop over the horizon and disappear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella heard the thunder of hooves just in time to dive to the side and avoid being trampled by the horse dashing past her, its rider controlling it with only his legs for he held a polearm in both hands, it too dipped over the horizon. Curious Rubella waited a moment and then heard the triumphant cry of a familiar young Qumranian cavalier. The cavalier&rsquo;s halberd was thrusted high into the air as he appeared again. His horse cantered about whilst he proudly paraded the body impaled on the spearhead of his halberd. Eshkol&rsquo;s body. The spearhead had pierced his abdomen like a cocktail stick might pierce a grape, blood stained his shirt but his body had gone limp and bounced around comically as he was waved about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got &lsquo;im, HA HA!&rdquo; yelled The cavalier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His peers met him with a chorus of cheer whilst Eshkol&rsquo;s men looked on in horror at the desecrated body of their lord being ridiculed before them. Some of Eshkol&rsquo;s men took it upon themselves to seek vengeance and caught some of Rubella&rsquo;s men off guard, but it was not enough, her men soon resumed their bloody battle. Qumran soldiers rained down steel upon the dwindling Nartsemnian numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella spotted Yissachar looking about himself, panicking. The Naruco had a pool of bodies both friend and foe around him. Bekarys charged, his sword held low like a lance, Yissachar saw him and swung his flail at Bekarys&rsquo; face. Bekarys raised his shield and blocked the flail only Yissachar saw the opening and threw a punch into Bekarys&rsquo; stomach that had him double over. Yissachar looked about him once more and saw that his men were fleeing. Rubella couldn&rsquo;t blame them, their defeat was all but assured and their one reason for coming here was now a morbid monument of Qumran&rsquo;s brutal victory. Yissachar followed his men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let The Naruco flee, let Nartsem know he&rsquo;s a coward,&rdquo; She took a deep breath and roared, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3">BUT KILL EVERY OTHER VIPER!</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her men roared in response and slew&mdash;no, butchered the Nartsemnians who could not flee in time. Rubella looked over the horizon and watched a small number of the retinue Yissachar had brought with him ri.lkmde off, back toward Bar&rsquo;Krans no doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella turned and looked over The Crossing. Blood stained the soil, her men wandered about the bodies making sure each one stayed down. The sun had finally risen over the mountains and bathed The Crossing in a grim light that shone on the surface of the shields and armour strewn about the ground.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You shoulda seen &lsquo;er blade, glowin&rsquo; like jasper in the daybreak.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d heard stories of &lsquo;er skill with th&rsquo; sword an&rsquo; tha&rsquo; peculiar blade of &lsquo;ers but I&rsquo;d always thought she was better with words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye but damn th&rsquo; lass puts many a man t&rsquo; shame.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella&rsquo;s men muttered as they watched her pass. Morale was at a high and few of her men had fallen in the chaos. Meir had tried to use the confusion to escape but Bekarys had found his feet and chased him down to the side of the pond. Rubella approached them, a swagger in her gait, she thrust something into Bekarys&rsquo; hands and gestured back toward the camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lord Meir,&rdquo; Rubella squatted before him and talked into his ear, &ldquo;tell me who the third key is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; He spat in her face. She grabbed him by his hair and pushed his head into the pond water and waited. She pulled his head back out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meir tried to speak between coughing and spluttering, &ldquo;You heartless bit&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His head went back under again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Changed your mind?&rdquo; Rubella asked raising his head a second time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meir shook his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good, I was getting quite bored.&rdquo; She put her hand out and Bekarys placed the hilt of Eskol&rsquo;s ornate knife in her hand, its edge glowing red from the fire it had been plunged into.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re an exorcist now,&rdquo; Meir shook his head but Rubella ignored him, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see how much you like fire.&rdquo; Bekarys forced Meir&rsquo;s mouth open and Rubella placed the flat of the blade against his tongue and relished in the hiss that sounded. Meir&rsquo;s eyes began to well up and he groaned in agony at the searing pain, his taste buds blistered and the blood vessels burst. Meir tried desperately to plead but Rubella continued for a moment longer before withdrawing the knife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rubella leant in and Meir whispered the name into her ear. She couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then, lets see how sharp this thing really is.&rdquo; Rubella pushed Meir&rsquo;s tongue to the roof of his mouth with her thumb and reached in with the knife in her other hand. Meir squirmed, tears rolling down his face in despair. With one swift cut the tongue was free of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth and blood gushed from the stump. Bekarys was horrified to have witnessed such brutality and turned away to wretch. Rubella took the wineskin from her hip and filled it with blood. Once she was done she let Meir&rsquo;s body fall face first into the grass, his blood running over into the pond beside him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c3">Hearts Of Gold Part I: The Bloody Dawn ~ Fin</span></p><div><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
