I'll keep this simple. This site is my passion project, something to keep me sane, let me share stories, ideas and other crap I come up with.
First and foremost it is a hobby and even if only you'll ever see it then it did its job perfectly.

## Hearts Of Gold

Hearts Of Gold is my main project. The reason I set out to make this site in the first place. Whilst playing D&D I came to discover that there is nothing better than sharing a story, seeing people's reactions, journeying through your own fantasy lands. So I decided to start writing a Novel (maybe more of a Novella considering my planned scope but we'll see). I'm enthralled with the medieval fantasy and political fantasy genres and the ways which magic can be expressed which became the main inspiration for the book. Though the series is written with little to no profanity or otherwise explicit scenes there will be moments of violence (as most conflicts are resolved in the fantasy genre). It should also be mentioned that although I have taken inspiration from the little of history and religion I know nothing in this series is based off of any sort of real events and any inspiration I've taken is *very* loose. Hearts Of Gold will be published weekly once the site is finished (when you're reading this it should be) though I cannot always guarantee that I'll remain on schedule, life is like that. If you want to see when the latest chapters are published then I suggest you subscribe to the RSS feed (more on that further on) and keep a keen eye on my twitter.

## How to use the site

If I'm being honest, this site is kind of weird, I may tweak things in the future but for now this is as much as I can manage. In order to access my writing ―that is to say book chapters― you must head to the search page, from there you can type the title name, chapter number, or series name and get a list of all matching chapters then simply click the one you want to read and you should be taken to the page. Simple enough. Here's the more technical part. Subscribing. My site has two RSS feeds namely [feed.xml](https://inky-blog.netlify.com/feed.xml) and [series.xml](https://inky-blog.netlify.com/series.xml). For the less acquainted (believe me I barely am) connecting an RSS reader to these files allows you to get updates whenever a chapter or post is released. The first feed is for posts such as the one you're reading right now whilst the second is for chapters that I publish (found on the enigmatic search page).
